Yesterday I thought it was because I wrote the fitbit in my dominant, so today wore them both same wrist but there's a large difference through the day. Im. Ot sure if i should be upset that the 10 isn't working or upset that the fitbit has been padding my ego and over counting. </p> <p>Any insight? </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Kallipiak\"> /u/Kallipiak </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/igjraxa56ncg1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/miband/comments/1q9oxkg/step_accuracy/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
