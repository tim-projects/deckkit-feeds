  "description": "<div><p>I’ve looked at a handful of CRM platforms over the past month, and the biggest issue hasn’t been price or features. It’s that so many of them feel like they’re designed for people who already have a system, like sales pipelines, forecasting, automations, and dashboards everywhere. It's all impressive but also a bit much when you’re just trying to get your footing.</p> <p>What I’m really trying to figure out is what the easiest CRM for beginners actually looks like in real life. Something that feels usable on day one, where adding contacts and keeping track of conversations doesn’t turn into a side project of its own.</p> <p>If you’ve gone through this stage before, I’m interested in what you gravitated toward early on and what you bounced off of. I'm mostly trying to avoid picking something that ends up half-set-up and ignored a month from now.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Dilder-Josen\"> /u/Dilder-Josen </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness/comments/1pukc6t/whats_the_easiest_crm_for_beginners/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness/comments/1pukc6t/whats_the_easiest_crm_for_beginners/\">[comments]</a></span>",
