  "description": "<div><p>Most businesses that have a good product or service fail because they don’t understand how to make growth repeatable. They spend on new channels or systems thinking that equals more money. Usually they’re just leaving revenue on the table from the channels they already have.</p> <p>Here’s the simplest way to explain what I’m talking about:</p> <p>• Get more qualified people into the funnel. Ads, outreach, and content targeted at intent, not just random traffic.</p> <p>• Convert more of them. Landing page and onboarding changes plus one clear lead magnet to capture more people.</p> <p>• Upsell more of the people you already have. Segmented nurture and low-friction offers that make upgrading obvious.</p> <p>• Keep them longer. Onboarding, value reminders, and lifecycle messaging that reduce churn.</p> <p>Every company that’s struggling to scale has a bottleneck in one of these areas. Fix that bottleneck and you’ll start to see results.</p> <p>If you’ve got traffic or users and need help with your entire funnel, comment or DM.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Striking-Reach4448\"> /u/Striking-Reach4448 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness/comments/1qck4o8/we_help_turn_existing_traffic_into_revenue/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness/comments/1qck4o8/we_help_turn_existing_traffic_into_revenue/\">[comments]</a></span>",
