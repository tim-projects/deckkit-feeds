  "description": "<div><p>Im running an ecommerce business for about 2 years now, im mostly selling on regional platforms but i recently saw huge potential in the US market, products are doing very well locally. Turns out the logistics of actually setting up shop in the US is way more complicated than I thought. I have been researching for weeks for what documentation i need and i need a commercial address to get started. I already got rejected from opening a seller account on one platform because my overseas address didnt cut it for their Kyc requirements. I found out i need proper lease agreement in my business name. Anyone here gone through this process? Budget isnt huge so im trying to figure out the most cost effective way to do this properly. Any advice would be appreciated.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Western-Bend-1677\"> /u/Western-Bend-1677 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness/comments/1qb0x5f/trying_to_scale_to_us_market_from_overseas/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness/comments/1qb0x5f/trying_to_scale_to_us_market_from_overseas/\">[comments]</a></span>",
