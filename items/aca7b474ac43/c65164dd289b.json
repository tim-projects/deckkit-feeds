  "description": "<div><p>I run a digital products business from the Uk thats doing about $10k monthly, i have been thinking about Us expansion for months but the more I research the more it seems impossible without actually moving there. The regulatory requirements alone are confusing as hell. And apparently a lot of it requires you to have a physical Us presence with proper documentation. Do I need to rent office space in the Us even though I will never use it? That seems insane but i also dont wanna end up with legal problems or getting my accounts shut down. What setup actually works without flying there every month to deal with paperwork? Whats the minimum setup to do this right?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Electronic-Search437\"> /u/Electronic-Search437 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness/comments/1qej0rq/can_i_scale_to_the_us_without_being_physically/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness/comments/1qej0rq/can_i_scale_to_the_us_without_being_physically/\">[comments]</a></span>",
