  "description": "<div><p>Hey guys,</p> <p>I'm handling local SEO for my client for a few years now, and we're having a tough time getting their map listing to rank against their competitors. I've read on many posts here on Reddit that people say it's necessary to buy Google reviews to get things moving, but I'm worried about the risks to my client's good name. I don't want them to get spam or fake reviews. I just want ones that look real to give them the social proof they need to get noticed nearby and rank. If you've tried any sites for this, I'd like to know how it went based on your experience.</p> <p>These are the factors I’m looking to know: </p> <p>• Did you see your map rankings actually go up after you bought reviews?</p> <p>• Did the profiles look like real people, or were they obviously fake accounts?</p> <p>• Did the ratings stay up, or did they get taken down after a few weeks?</p> <p>I'm trying to decide if buying Google reviews is a good idea. If you have any advice or know safe places, please let me know. Any recommendations are appreciated.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/PhontomDX\"> /u/PhontomDX </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness/comments/1qh63qr/whats_the_best_site_to_buy_google_reviews/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness/comments/1qh63qr/whats_the_best_site_to_buy_google_reviews/\">[comments]</a></span>",
