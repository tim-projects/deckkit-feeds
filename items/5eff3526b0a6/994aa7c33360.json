  "description": "<div><p>This f***ing sucks. I’ve been fighting to keep my small team intact, but now I have to let go of the best sysadmin I’ve ever worked with. Not because he messed up. Not because of drama. Just cold, brutal economics.</p> <p>He’s got that rare combo: deep tech chops, calm under fire, and knows how to talk to everyone — from end users to C-levels. People love working with him. He’s the guy who makes you feel like things are under control even when everything’s burning.</p> <p>Now? Being replaced by someone overseas because the numbers look better on a spreadsheet.</p> <p>I’ve watched this guy hold the fort when everything else was crumbling. He’s loyal. Professional. Human. I’d rehire him in a heartbeat if I could.</p> <p>So yeah, if anyone’s looking for a rock-solid SysAdmin or experienced help desk pro in Atlanta, GA — someone who gets it done and keeps people happy — hit me up. You won’t find better.</p> <p>Anyone hiring?</p>  <p>[UPDATE] Holy crap! What have I done?!</p> <p>I knew this community was amazing - but what happened after that post is just insane. Over 1.6 million views in 24hrs. Hundreds of comments, shares, DMs. I’m floored. Cannot stop smiling. </p> <p>THANK YOU. Seriously. Every single one of you who commented, boosted the post, reached out - you're awesome. I’ve been replying to messages for hours and yeah, it's exhausting, but absolutely worth it. My guy’s inbox is now a warzone because I’ve been spamming him with so many contacts and leads he might start regretting ever working with me haha.</p> <p>But here's the best part: he’s already connected with a bunch of you. He even had an interview, and even got invited to the next phase!!! </p> <p>This blew past anything I hoped for. I love you all.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/namidul\"> /u/namidul </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1juegh5/i_have_to_let_go_of_my_best_sysadmin_not_because/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1juegh5/i_have_to_let_go_of_my_best_sysadmin_not_because/\">[comments]</a></span>",
