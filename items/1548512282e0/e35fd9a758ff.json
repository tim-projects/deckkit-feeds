  "description": "<div><p>I really need some advice, a few days ago a friend convinced me to try it with him, before I even got done exhaling the room spun and I was locked inside the person who bullied me for 4 years. 3 of those I spent bullying myself. I understand it was just brain glitching but it’s so hard to wrap my head around this, and any advice would be appreciated. I am now feeling more empathy towards her but at the same time I’m having solipsistic thoughts because subjectively it felt real, her parents, friends, activities, it was all there, I walked past myself, talked to myself, from her pov. I’m confused, any advice is appreciated</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Full-Job-5543\"> /u/Full-Job-5543 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Salvia/comments/1qh5vzj/smoked_400x_and_lived_as_my_hs_bully_for_3_years/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Salvia/comments/1qh5vzj/smoked_400x_and_lived_as_my_hs_bully_for_3_years/\">[comments]</a></span>",
