  "description": "<div><p>I've been getting them for years now. I don't know how to describe it except it's like getting a very gentle push on your arms or legs by someone... but they're not there. It feels like they're trying to get my attention for something.</p> <p>I work from home and was falling asleep today during a call with a client and right before I closed my eyes, I was nudged on my right leg and it woke me right up before I could fall asleep on this call. If I would've slept through the rest of the shift and missed that call along with any others, it could've been seen as \"call avoidance\" and possibly lead to a warning or much worse.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/executor-of-judgment\"> /u/executor-of-judgment </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/1qe1ksv/does_anyone_else_here_get_physical_nudges_from/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/1qe1ksv/does_anyone_else_here_get_physical_nudges_from/\">[comments]</a></span>",
