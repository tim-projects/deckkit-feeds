  "description": "<div><p>Hi, I just discovered this sub, so forgive me if I’m covering old discussion points. </p> <p>Around early 2025 I began hearing spiritually sensitive people in my life and on YouTube channels saying things were going to get much worse than imagined in US and that suddenly, when no-one expects it, it changes dramatically for the better. </p> <p>Numerous people I am close to who have some very accurate premonitions have said “everyone needs to be settled and prepared by the 2025 holidays/early 2026”, </p> <p>“early 2026 - by mid-February- things will get really bad but then a change for the better will occur suddenly and unexpectedly” </p> <p>and also “not clear when, but there will be a massive debt forgiveness that will change the lives of the majority of people. The US will not be the only place impacted”. </p> <p>What are the thoughts, senses, and premonitions that sensitive people here are getting about the state of things in US and about 2026 in general? </p> <p>Looking forward to your posts!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/hans99hans\"> /u/hans99hans </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/1qdtjt5/state_of_usa/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/1qdtjt5/state_of_usa/\">[comments]</a></span>",
