  "description": "<div><p>(WKBN) – Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) has introduced a bill to establish that citizens of the United States “must have sole and exclusive allegiance to the U.S.”</p> <p>The “Exclusive Citizenship Act of 2025” would make it so that no one may be a citizen or national of the U.S. while simultaneously having any foreign citizenship. If passed, a U.S. citizen who voluntarily acquires foreign citizenship would have to relinquish their U.S. citizenship after the date of enactment.</p> <p>Those who have dual citizenship would have to submit a written renunciation of foreign citizenship to the secretary of State or a written renunciation of U.S. citizenship to the secretary of Homeland Security no later than one year after the enactment of the act.</p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5629349-ohio-moreno-us-dual-citizenship/\">https://thehill.com/policy/international/5629349-ohio-moreno-us-dual-citizenship/</a></p> <p>I posted this in another immigrant subreddit for Americans and it was immediately removed. I hope it’s alright if I post it here. This is worrying information and I hope nothing comes of this bill.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/an-imperfect-boot\"> /u/an-imperfect-boot </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1pcf3r4/news_ohio_senator_bernie_moreno_introduces_bill/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1pcf3r4/news_ohio_senator_bernie_moreno_introduces_bill/\">[comments]</a></span>",
