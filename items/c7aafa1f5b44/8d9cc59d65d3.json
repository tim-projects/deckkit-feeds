  "description": "<div><p>Hi everyone. </p> <p>I am a highschool/college graduate in Gaza and looking to move to basically anywhere I can continue my education. After reaching out to a lawyer from Pak, she has agreed to sponsor the majority of my travel expense to Pakistan where I can hopefully apply for admission in university. </p> <p>Now I know the Rafah crossing is entirely closed and we have some “people movers” available who charge alot of money but that is something I cannot afford. (I also do not have Israeli citizenship as I am from Gaza and therefore there is no way Israeli authorities will allow me to fly out.)</p> <p>Can someone please advise me what to do in this situation or who to reach out to?</p> <p>Any sort of guidance works. </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/OkLock8588\"> /u/OkLock8588 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1ngk2ox/iwantout_19m_palestinepakistan/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1ngk2ox/iwantout_19m_palestinepakistan/\">[comments]</a></span>",
