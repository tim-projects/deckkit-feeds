  "description": "<div><p>I’m 21. Woman. Palestinian (West Bank). Atheist. One year left in a CS degree I hate. I just want to breathe and dance I think. Start over. Study something else.Live something that’s actually mine without shame, without fear, without being crushed by what it means to be a Palestinian ex-Muslim woman here.(What I wear, what I say, how I act, even how I think) Spoiler: I think everyone hates me. (My community,the “enemies.” - madness both sides -) I’ve been thinking about EU/Canada, but I have no idea what the hell to do or where to begin. Has anyone actually made it out? Through study, asylum, anything?</p> <p>Any advice, experience would honestly mean a lot.</p> <p>I think I felt safer before I post this LMAO</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Lee_or\"> /u/Lee_or </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1kydjhz/iwantout_21f_palestine_canada/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1kydjhz/iwantout_21f_palestine_canada/\">[comments]</a></span>",
