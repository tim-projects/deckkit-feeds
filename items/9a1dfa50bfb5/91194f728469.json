This slowdown is primarily driven by a ceiling in youth survival; with infant mortality now approaching near zero, the massive statistical boosts of the 20th century have evaporated. </p> <p>Consequently, future community-scale life expectancies can no longer rely on general public health trends but must depend entirely on radically slowing biological aging.</p> <p>In essence, less low-hanging fruit and fewer easy wins are slowing the life expectancy gains of the general populace. Not exactly a groundbreaking revelation in and of itself, but it does challenge several popularly held beliefs, impacting everything from traditional linear-based pension models to the idea that mere passivity will continue to reap rewards. </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Altruistic_Angle5908\"> /u/Altruistic_Angle5908 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://neura.health/insight/new-study-explains-why-rate-of-life-expectancy-increase-is-slowing\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/1qcyivm/new_study_reveals_why_the_rapid_rise_in_life/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
