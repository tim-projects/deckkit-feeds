  "description": "<div><p>LEGALLY. </p> <p>Aside from Netflix (I personally really like the Viet dub of Mitchells vs the Machines; the Netflix originals tend to have them, like K-Pop Demon Hunters for instance) and the only Disney+ film with a Viet track (Raya), you can purchase both current Spider verse movies and Wild Robot on Google Play for Google TV, and I think you can get them on iTunes too~</p> <p>The subtitles may not match though, I assume because of regionalisms (northern subs instead of southern dub?)... There are indeed localizations to match lip flap, but if you have enough familiarity with the language, it's actually super educational listening to the vocabulary choices!</p> <p>Bonus: If you're crazy pants, you won't find legit physical copies with Vietnamese dubs in Vietnam itself... Either I couldn't find them, or they don't exist. Instead, try Singapore in a Poh Kim video store. The only Blu-Rays I found with Viet dub tracks were Wreck-It Ralph, How To Train Your Dragon 2, and Kung Fu Panda 3.</p> <p>I hope this helps! I spent years looking for this kind of info and kept finding the same 3-5 reddit threads in vain.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Hnilmik\"> /u/Hnilmik </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://v.redd.it/y4jiq09zn9dg1\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/learnvietnamese/comments/1qcgzsi/for_usa_learners_wanting_to_study_vietnamese_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",
