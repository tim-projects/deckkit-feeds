  "description": "<div><p>I keep having this small but annoying problem when I’m in Vietnam.</p> <p>When I talk to random locals, I start in Vietnamese. Every time. But after a few sentences, they switch to English anyway. Even when my Vietnamese isn’t <em>that</em> bad. It’s like the moment they hear an accent, they decide English is easier.</p> <p>What’s interesting is that when I’m with my girlfriend, people usually stick with Vietnamese and actually try to understand me. But when I’m alone, especially with younger people or anyone who knows English, they flip to English really fast.</p> <p>I get that they’re being nice, and I don’t blame them. But I’m here, in Vietnam, and I’m trying to practice Vietnamese in real life. It just makes things harder when the conversation keeps switching languages.</p> <p>Is there a natural or polite way to signal that I want to keep speaking Vietnamese? Like something locals won’t find awkward or rude, but still gets the point across</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Snoo49959\"> /u/Snoo49959 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/learnvietnamese/comments/1q76h39/how_do_i_stop_locals_from_switching_to_english_on/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/learnvietnamese/comments/1q76h39/how_do_i_stop_locals_from_switching_to_english_on/\">[comments]</a></span>",
