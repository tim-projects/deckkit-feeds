  "description": "<div><p>Nghỉ” means to take a break or to rest in Vietnamese. It is often combined with another verb to show that you stop doing a specific activity for a period of time, for example: - nghỉ học – to take a break from studying / to have time off from school - nghỉ làm – to take time off work</p> <p>One of my students messaged me in Vietnamese: “Chào cô, thứ Năm tuần này là năm mới, chúng ta nghỉ học phải không?” (Hello teacher, this Thursday is New Year. Do we have a break from class?)</p> <p>He used the word “nghỉ” correctly in this context. As for me, I’ll also take this time to rest and get ready for the new year ☺️</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Northernvietnamese\"> /u/Northernvietnamese </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/xw801hvn3dag1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/learnvietnamese/comments/1pzld4j/learn_northern_vietnamese/\">[comments]</a></span>",
