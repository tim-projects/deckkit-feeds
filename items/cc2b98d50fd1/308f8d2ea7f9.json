  "description": "<div><p>bought my new Hokas late December, and at time it really helped walking with my arthritis. I could walk abit quicker and they are super comfortable.</p> <p>However, I notice after I get home and rest, I have hip and knee pain.</p> <p>I don't have money to just buy a different set. Just wondering if anyone has had this issue, and maybe it gets better? :(</p> <p>If worst comes to worse I will get a different brand, maybe Brooks Ghost or whatever a podiatrist suggests.</p> <p>I got these as originally a podiatrist recommended Hoka and rocker sole shoes.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Calm_B4_TheStorm\"> /u/Calm_B4_TheStorm </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Thritis/comments/1qg66qt/hoka_bondi_9/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Thritis/comments/1qg66qt/hoka_bondi_9/\">[comments]</a></span>",
