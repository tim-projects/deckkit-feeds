  "description": "<div><p>Hello all, I am dealing with an extremely aggressive entity that sexually assaults me and even tries killing me. Its aware and conscious but cannot or refuses to be reasonable and leave me alone even after 4+ months of dealing with it.</p> <p>I am now in the later stages of this issue and became possessed.</p> <p>I have been to people who do entity removal and clearing yet it did not help. I have a few thoughts on why.</p> <p>If you have ever dealt with aggressive entity’s as a practitioner or the one suffering from the attachment and found relief through someone I would appreciate it greatly if you could dm me with any information.</p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/New_Obligation896\"> /u/New_Obligation896 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1qe3baw/extremely_aggressive_entity/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1qe3baw/extremely_aggressive_entity/\">[comments]</a></span>",
