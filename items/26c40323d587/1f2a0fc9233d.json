  "description": "<div><p>Everything. Literally everything, from the clothes you wear, the apps you use, the food you buy, the water you drink, everything contains the collective energetic residue of whatever it interacted with during its lifetime. If you listen to a piece of music or watch a film, you are interacting with its energy field, and it will affect you. It certainly will register in your consciousness, carrying ALL energetic information from the film actors and the directors to your consciousness. The same is true with everything else.</p> <p>I'm just having an epiphany, but I'm sure many people in this subreddit also experienced similar things like I did.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/HyHoang\"> /u/HyHoang </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1qcsxx1/everything_literally_has_a_vibration_and_what_you/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1qcsxx1/everything_literally_has_a_vibration_and_what_you/\">[comments]</a></span>",
