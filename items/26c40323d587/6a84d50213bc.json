  "description": "<div><p>Through all these years i have been bullied by my sister and classmates about my looks it's not as if im ugly or anything but my eyes , they are just kinda hooded like a korean and the people of my country certainly don't like that feature........so recently i have created a foundation of healing in myself and now if anyone bullies me about that feature it just filters out from my brain and i just don't care and i remain unbothered. </p> <p>But the question is even after not letting bullying affect my consciousness which i thought universe wanted me to do, still the cycle keeps repeating idk what universe whants me to learn from this im exhausted and frustrated. </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/godzill007\"> /u/godzill007 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1qe9ehf/what_is_the_universe_trying_to_tell_me_with_this/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1qe9ehf/what_is_the_universe_trying_to_tell_me_with_this/\">[comments]</a></span>",
