  "description": "<div><p>I had a deep plane lower facelift, and a neck lift with MyEllevate. I know it's only been 5 weeks, and it's still going to change, but so far I am really happy (after several weeks of being terrified that I was going to have giant lips and cheeks for the rest of my life).</p> <p>I'm 53 and had lost a ton of weight. In one year I went from looking younger than my age, to looking old and haggard. </p> <p>BTW, I'm not frowning in the before picture or smiling in the after picture, that's my neutral resting face in both pictures. I love that I no longer have resting frowny-face! </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/SelfishMom\"> /u/SelfishMom </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/o3hwt2o4pceg1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/PlasticSurgery/comments/1qhcmdf/5_weeks_post_neck_and_lower_face/\">[comments]</a></span>",
