  "description": "<div><p>I’m officially one year post-op from my rhinoplasty, and honestly, it changed my life.</p> <p>I always had a big nose, and people including my own family never let me forget it. Having a twin sister who didn’t have one made it even harder. I compared myself to her constantly, avoided photos, and felt uncomfortable in my own face. It really messed with my confidence and how I showed up in the world.</p> <p>The recovery was super easy, but now that I’m a year out, I’m really happy I did it. The way I see myself is completely different. I’m more confident, less anxious, and way more comfortable in social situations. I’ve also noticed people treat me more positively, which is wild but real.</p> <p>It didn’t solve all my problems, but it removed a huge insecurity that had been weighing on me for years and my quality of life is genuinely better because of it.</p> <p>If you’re thinking about rhinoplasty: do it for yourself, and be patient with healing. It really takes a full year to settle.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Instruction-Tiny\"> /u/Instruction-Tiny </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qhn1gg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/PlasticSurgery/comments/1qhn1gg/my_nose_job_changed_my_life/\">[comments]</a></span>",
