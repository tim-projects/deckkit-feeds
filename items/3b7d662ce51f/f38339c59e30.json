  "description": "<div><p>i didnt know about this forum til yesterday and i really loved my experience with FFS and Dr. DB so I wanted to share my experience. </p> <p><strong>The procedures I did were:</strong></p> <p>* Fat Grafting (cheeks and lips)</p> <p>* Tracheal Shave</p> <p>* Forehead Contouring</p> <p>* Scalp Advancement</p> <p>* Brow Lift</p> <p>* Rhinoplasty</p> <p>My recovery was hard for the first 2 weeks but then it got easier as time went on and then it was just waiting for the swelling to go down. I feel very lucky with how everything went and how I recovered and I would go back and do it all over again if given the choice :)</p> <p>The only other surgery I might do next is a hair transplant to fill in my corners a little more but i really dont want to have to shave part of my head to do it so i have to find someone good here in LA who's very good!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/k3tten\"> /u/k3tten </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qeo96q\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/PlasticSurgery/comments/1qeo96q/my_ffs_results_at_15_years_from_dr_deschampsbraly/\">[comments]</a></span>",
