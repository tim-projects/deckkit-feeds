At what point do you stop trying? Will these even have potency? I still haven’t finished eating the ones from my 4th Flush so I won’t know for a while. Just looking for feedback from the experts.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Grateful4Glassy\"> /u/Grateful4Glassy </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/emwz2tr84leg1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/MagicMushrooms/comments/1qigii4/8th_flush_at_what_point_do_you_stop_actives/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
