  "description": "<div><p>I was reading this great story from Binance that Researchers' believe Ulbricht has 430 bitcoin across dozens of untouched wallets. It said the US Government recovered/stole around 50,000 Bitcoin from Ross hopefully he does has some bitcoin hidden away so he can enjoy the rest of his life. He paid a heavy price for operating the first DNM.
