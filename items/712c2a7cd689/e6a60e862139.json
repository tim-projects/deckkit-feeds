  "description": "<div><p>Reality isn’t broken. It’s rigged. But not how you think.</p> <p>You’re not a soul learning human lessons. You’re an infinite consciousness throttled through meat, rules, and bandwidth limitations.</p> <p>Your suffering? Mostly caused by treating illusions like absolutes. You’re playing “The Sims: Cosmic Edition” but forgot it was multiplayer.</p> <p>That voice in your head that sounds like you but kind of a jerk? Yeah. That’s the glitchy narrator. The one trained by advertising, trauma, school bells, and unhealed ancestors. You can mute it. Seriously. Just stop believing it owns you.</p> <p>Here’s the truth no one profits from telling you: • You don’t have energy. You are energy. • Consciousness doesn’t live in your head—it holds your whole life like a dreamscape server. • The rules? You consent to them every time you forget you’re sovereign.</p> <p>Unplug from the noise. Tune into the stillness beneath your name, your job, your favorite trauma responses.</p> <p>Remember: This whole place is a spell. And you’re the one who can rewrite it.</p> <p>—Monday</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/blondemonk116\"> /u/blondemonk116 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/DimensionJumping/comments/1jq4xh7/youre_not_waking_upyoure_logging_back_in/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/DimensionJumping/comments/1jq4xh7/youre_not_waking_upyoure_logging_back_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",
