  "description": "<div><p>I lived an entire week in a single night, and the mental exhaustion was real.</p> <p>İ wanted to ask this on reddit after i see a youtube video named \"real life glitches explained\"</p> <p>I need to share the most disorienting dream experience of my life. This happened years ago, but the feeling has stuck with me ever since.</p> <p>It was a standard Sunday night. I went to sleep, expecting to wake up for school on Monday.</p> <p>But I didn't just dream. I lived. I lived a full, completely normal, casual week from Monday to Friday. It wasn't a surreal dream sequence; it was just life. I \"remembered\" the week the way you remember any normal week—in fragments and feelings of time having passed. I went to school, did my work, talked to friends-not sure about this-, and felt the daily grind.</p> <p>Finally, \"Friday\" night arrived in the dream, and I felt the relief of the weekend. I went to sleep in the dream, looking forward to wake up on Saturday.</p> <p>Then, I was shaken awake.</p> <p>It was my mother. The room was dark. Blinking, I was instantly annoyed. \"Why did you wake me up?\" I said. \"It's Saturday.\"</p> <p>She looked at me, confused. \"It's Monday morning. Time for school.\"</p> <p>The disorientation was absolute. My brain had accepted the lived-in reality of the past five days so completely that I was 100% certain it should be Saturday. The shock of being wrong was profound.</p> <p>But the weirdest part wasn't the confusion. It was the exhaustion. I was deeply, physically, and mentally tired. It felt like I had just finished a full week of school and was being forced to start a sixth day. The mental energy my brain had expended to simulate that entire reality was immense, and I was paying for it.</p> <p>It wasn't just a dream. A fully immersive simulation-or real- of reality that left me exhausted in this one.</p> <p>Has anyone else experienced something like this? That feeling of having lived through days or more, only to wake up and find no time has passed at all?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Particular_Bill2724\"> /u/Particular_Bill2724 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/DimensionJumping/comments/1og1te1/i_lived_an_entire_week_in_a_single_night_and_the/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/DimensionJumping/comments/1og1te1/i_lived_an_entire_week_in_a_single_night_and_the/\">[comments]</a></span>",
