  "description": "<div><p>Hit my number last year (about 30x expenses through index funds + got lucky with some tech stocks) and moved abroad to slow travel. The money part is working fine but there's a bunch of operational stuff i just didnt account for</p> <p>Spending across multiple countries is way more annoying than i expected, constant fraud alerts, fx fees adding up, exchange rate spreads eating into budget more than projected. Feels like i optimized the accumulation phase perfectly but totally missed the spending infrastructure, also dealing with address verification for random services, time zone issues for managing accounts, some brokerages getting weird about foreign IPs, that kind of thing</p> <p>Curious what blindspots other people hit after pulling the trigger that werent in any of the FI blogs or calculators? </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Long_Lie8296\"> /u/Long_Lie8296 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ExpatFIRE/comments/1q7r11r/what_unexpected_problems_did_you_actually_hit/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ExpatFIRE/comments/1q7r11r/what_unexpected_problems_did_you_actually_hit/\">[comments]</a></span>",
