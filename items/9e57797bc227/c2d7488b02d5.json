  "description": "<div><p>Sometimes I get perplexed, even disheartened by mostly American posters \"3m NW. Can I Fire in Spain?\" (I can't even believe they're real, or maybe just looking for an ego massage?)</p> <p>And also most of the posts seem to discourage people and are always extremely negative. \"500k? Not enough. Wait until 700k. It'll be more comfortable.\"</p> <p>\"700k? I wouldn't just yet. Work a few more years and that 700k will be 1 million.\"</p> <p>\"1 million. Close, but I'd be targeting 1.5 million to be safe\"</p> <p>Anyway in this case: 38. Single. No health insurance costs (free healthcare). Targeting SEA/Latm/Southern Europe. 700k invested. 50k cash buffer. Possible? Anybody doing it or have done it? </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/sap303\"> /u/sap303 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ExpatFIRE/comments/1q1w0ii/is_ti_possible_to_slow_travel_forever_on_700k/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ExpatFIRE/comments/1q1w0ii/is_ti_possible_to_slow_travel_forever_on_700k/\">[comments]</a></span>",
