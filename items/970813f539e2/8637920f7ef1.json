  "description": "<div><p>Starting with a peak experience about seven years ago that eased my lifelong depression, I've been exploring the combination of ketamine and yogic breathing (pranayama).</p> <p>I journey about once a month. Usually I'm on a meditation cushion in a dark room, consciously breathing, allowing language to dissolve, losing the sense of my body...</p> <p>These experiences are almost impossible to describe. Bizarre hallucinations in the dark, awe and wonder, love, death, the mystery of being... Eventually I return to my body, language comes back online, then I travel through my memories and have experiences I can actually remember and describe.</p> <p>I'm 55 and the 40 years of depression really seems to be over. There are many other factors besides conscious breathing in the ketamine state -- plenty of other psychedelics, special shout out to 5-MeO-DMT, and therapy. But nothing -- for me -- compares to practicing pranayama near the ineffable ketamine peak!</p> <p>Any folks practicing in similar ways here?</p> <p>(I can't believe I'm just finding out about DIYtk! I started the sub <a href=\"/r/KetamineStateYoga\">r/KetamineStateYoga</a> in 2022 and am only now finding out DIYtk exists -- And in fact this seems much closer to my approach to ketamine than other boards I found out about right away, such as <a href=\"/r/TherapeuticKetamine\">r/TherapeuticKetamine</a>. So maybe I can blame the algorithm? I don't know -- I'm a bit older than most folks on Reddit so haha I wind up confused a lot!)</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Psychedelic-Yogi\"> /u/Psychedelic-Yogi </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYtk/comments/1qd4xqz/cultivating_mystical_experience_with_ketamine/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYtk/comments/1qd4xqz/cultivating_mystical_experience_with_ketamine/\">[comments]</a></span>",
