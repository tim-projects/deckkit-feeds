  "description": "<div><p>New consumer trust report came out. 78% of Gen Z can identify AI generated images and will scroll past them.</p> <p>Been running ads for an apparel brand targeting 18 to 25 year olds. Our CTR dropped 40% after we switched to AI generated lifestyle shots.</p> <p>The images looked fine to me. Models wearing the clothes, decent lighting, no obvious errors. But apparently Gen Z can tell.</p> <p>Went back to real product photos and performance recovered. Not fully but better than the AI stuff.</p> <p>The report mentioned things like lighting inconsistencies and unnatural shadows. Stuff that's not obvious unless you're looking for it.</p> <p>AI images probably work for some audiences but not others. Older demographics might not notice or care as much.</p> <p>Edit: for graphics and layouts i use X-Design since you control the inputs. But for photography targeting younger audiences, real still wins.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Objective-Feed7250\"> /u/Objective-Feed7250 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1qch0v1/gen_z_can_spot_lazy_ai_images_and_its_hurting/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1qch0v1/gen_z_can_spot_lazy_ai_images_and_its_hurting/\">[comments]</a></span>",
