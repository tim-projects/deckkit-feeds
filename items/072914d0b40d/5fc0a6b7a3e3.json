  "description": "<div><p>I have been reading a lot of comments here recently and I would like to share my own perspective. My English is not very good so I am using AI to help me translate this because the automatic translation on Reddit is often inaccurate.</p> <p>I have been here for three days and I think I have found the reason for the gap between us. I see a lot of respect for the philosophy but a bit of disdain for the religion.</p> <p>We have to admit that the original philosophy of Laozi and Zhuangzi was a wisdom for the minority. It was an intellectual pursuit for the elites. They did not entirely create these ideas from scratch but rather they were organizers who gathered ancient wisdom and added their own understanding. It was beautiful but it was high above the ground.</p> <p>Then we came to the Eastern Han Dynasty. It was a time of great suffering with endless wars and plagues. The common people did not need the profound concept of \"The Tao\" or abstract emptiness. They needed to survive. They needed real medicine and disaster relief and they needed to know their souls would be safe.</p> <p>That is when Ancestral Master Zhang Daoling stood up. He deified Laozi and established the Tianshi Dao. This marked the birth of Taoism as a religion with organizations and Gods and a system of medical and psychological comfort that could save people on a large scale.</p> <p>Later the elites of the Wei and Jin dynasties refined this foundation. They transformed it into something more elegant to satisfy both the desire for physical immortality and spiritual transcendence. This is how the Shangqing school was born. It had a high aesthetic. But because the visualization techniques of Shangqing were too difficult for most people the practice of Internal Alchemy began to rise. That is how we got to the structure we have today.</p> <p>I just want to say that we should respect history. I do not deny that in the process of becoming a religion some essence was lost. Sometimes we are told how to do things but not why. But the root cause of the religious form is simply that the Chinese people wanted to live.</p> <p>We have a core concept called Xian Dao Gui Sheng which means the Tao values life. This is very different from the Western view of waiting for death to go to heaven. We want to find eternity in the body we have now.</p> <p>Finally, no matter what, I hope you can understand and remember this. Even though Taoism was refined into a religion for the elites later on, at its very beginning, it was just about countless ordinary people wanting to survive, that is all.</p> <p>P.S: The photo shows the Taoist temple where I reside. This is the place of my personal cultivation</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/TheDaoistMaster\"> /u/TheDaoistMaster </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/1lauh8yelvdg1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1qf8kyg/i_understand_the_disconnect_between_taoist/\">[comments]</a></span>",
