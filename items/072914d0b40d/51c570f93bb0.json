  "description": "<div><p>I don’t need to find meaning because there cannot be meaning to this. </p> <p>Question 1: how can I begin to process this daily trauma in a Taoist manner? I’m not and never have been religious, and I’m drawn to Taoism for its focus on acceptance, serenity, balance, and nature. </p> <p>My follow up question; how does Taoism think of death and the afterlife? </p> <p>I loved the scene in The White Lotus when the monk explains the Buddhist interpretation: we are all part of the ocean. For a brief moment we are a drop of water that separates from the ocean and rises into the air (our life) then falls and rejoins the water (death). </p> <p>Edit: I am brought to tears by all of the kindness in the replies. It goes to show that Taoism attracts the best kind of people. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of the guidance and suggestions. I will be returning to your comments every day. </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/PoppyAndMerlin\"> /u/PoppyAndMerlin </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1qbi5jo/my_4_year_old_has_an_aggressive_brain_tumor_thats/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1qbi5jo/my_4_year_old_has_an_aggressive_brain_tumor_thats/\">[comments]</a></span>",
