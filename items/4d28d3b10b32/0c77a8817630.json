  "description": "<div><p>I saw something last night like that, and I've been questioning our existence since. My neighbor saw it with me too, so I know it was real. We were watching a satellite go across the sky, right by the 3rd star down the handle on the Big Dipper. The satellite went on by, then the unexplainable happened a second later. It was like the sky glitched out for a few seconds, as if someone smeared the sky with their hand in a particular area, like it was pixelated or had some strange pattern over it, kind of in a striped, flowing square shape. I thought my eyes played a trick on me, but then my neighbor said, \"DUDE!! DID YOUR SEE THAT?!\" I couldn't believe she saw it too, then every hair on my body stood straight up. I was speechless, and still am. Are we in a created world? Is this a simulation? What did I just experience?! I can't wrap my head about what we saw last night... that's why I'm here. Please enlighten me!!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/ElectronicEmploy3049\"> /u/ElectronicEmploy3049 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1mmmcr8/the_sky_glitched_out_last_night_my_neighbor_with/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1mmmcr8/the_sky_glitched_out_last_night_my_neighbor_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",
