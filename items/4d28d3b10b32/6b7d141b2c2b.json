  "description": "<div><p>It was a random Friday night, as we sat and talked about family on the couch. Suddenly, my mom's face became pixelated like a computer program for a split second. </p> <p>I wasn't drunk nor on any drug. I was completely clear-minded. My eyesight is 19/20. </p> <p>It creeped me out so much I haven't been able to come back to see her since. </p> <p>And that's not even the weirdest part. My mom has also been very strange and distant towards me since that day (via texts and calls).</p> <p>Yesterday, I plucked up all my courage to call and tell her this, and guess what she said?</p> <p>\"I saw your face did the same thing!\"</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/hansontranhai\"> /u/hansontranhai </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1nrizi2/i_saw_my_moms_face_became_pixelated_like_a/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1nrizi2/i_saw_my_moms_face_became_pixelated_like_a/\">[comments]</a></span>",
