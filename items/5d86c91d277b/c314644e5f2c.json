After that post he did come back and tried for about a week to reconnect but it was all very weird so I also very much took a step back. The final straw was when he called me and then tried to act like nothing had happened. I broke up with him that same day and he messaged me a day after saying he would like to explain but he never followed through. Now there was two months of silence and he suddenly sent me this on Saturday. It was 5 am for him.
