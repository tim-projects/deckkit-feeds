  "description": "<div><p>(based on what is working in my life, what I've observed, what i've read, etc. They may not apply to everyone but even if it helps a couple of people I'll be happy)</p> <p><strong>These are things to practice in any kind of relationship</strong>, especially with friends or acquaintances where the \"risk\" feels a lot smaller than in romantic relationships.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Practice naming emotions -</strong> instead of reacting with withdrawal or defensiveness;</li> <li><strong>Track triggers</strong> - separate past from present by noticing when old wounds (abandonment, betrayal, neglect) are flaring up, and don't let them fool you into thinking they're facts (ex.: “X disagreed with me, they're starting to hate me” / “X is asking for more attention, they want to control me” / \"X didn't want to have sex, they're no longer attracted to me\" / \"X complained about something I did, I can't to anything right/how dare they, don't they know how hard I'm trying??\" / etc.); </li> <li><strong>Build emotional awareness -</strong> when you see yourself reacting in a big way or repeating old patterns, stop and think about why you're acting that way;</li> <li><strong>Self-sooth -</strong> learn to regulate emotions <em>before</em> acting on them (deep breathing, journaling, going for a walk, delaying a response until calm, etc.) </li> <li><strong>Challenge your automatic thoughts</strong> - (ex.: from “I lose myself if i get attached” to \"I can still be my own person even if I'm with someone.\" From “If I depend on someone, they'll use it against me,” to \"there's people in my life who haven't done that.\" From “Good things don't last,” to \"but i don't have to sabotage it to end earlier, I can just enjoy <em>while</em> it lasts.\" Etc.)</li> <li><strong>Understand boundaries</strong> - they are not punishment, so don't take other's boundaries to heart, and don't make yours up to hurt others.</li> <li><strong>Build tolerance for closeness</strong> <ul> <li>micro-dose closeness: text back instead of ghosting, say “I missed you” even if it feels vulnerable, or initiate a hangout. </li> <li>Ride the wave: When anxiety rises, instead of escaping or lashing out, breathe and wait 30 minutes, that's enough time for your brain to calm back down.</li> <li>Practice staying after conflict: Don’t bolt after an argument; learn to de-escalate and repair.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Learn healthy dependency -</strong> for us, dependency feels dangerous because it meant rejection in the past, we often swing between <em>over-giving</em> and <em>withdrawing</em>, but secure attachment is about <strong>inter</strong>dependence.</li> <li><strong>Accept care</strong> - practice accepting when someone shows you kindness without always assuming the worst, or like now you \"owe\" them something;</li> <li><strong>Ask for help</strong> - you need to teach your brain to see reliance as safe;</li> <li><strong>Rebuild Trust in Relationships -</strong> FA's usually have histories of abuse, neglect, or mixed signals, so trust is fragile. We need consistent experiences that prove: <ul> <li>People can stay even if we mess up;</li> <li>Conflict or needing space don't always equal rejection or aggression;</li> <li>Just because someone messed up or failed doesn't \"prove\" you can't trust anyone, nobody's perfect and we should show the grace we want people to show us;</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Stay curious -</strong> don't make assumptions about people's thoughts or intents, you can literally ask people what they mean or what's going on for them;</li> <li><strong>Rebuild trust in yourself -</strong> I'd say most FA's struggle with self-love, every time we fail or do something bad we chastise ourselves and feel bad, and then we point that anger at whoever put us in that position, so it's really important to practice being better for others so we can be better for ourselves; <ul> <li><strong>Practice consistency and reliability with follow-through</strong>: (ex.: if you say “I’ll call you,” actually call, or if you agree to a meet-up, show up on time) it builds confidence that you <em>can</em> be reliable;</li> <li><strong>Self-care</strong>: sleep, exercise, socialize, eat properly, </li> <li><strong>Repair</strong>: If you shut down, snap at someone, are too critical, get defensive, etc. <em>Acknowledge it</em> (ex.: “I'm overwhelmed/scared/feeling pressured\"). <em>Apologize</em> (ex.: \"I'm sorry I reacted that way/said those things\"). <em>Repair</em> (“I want to try again/reconnect/understand you better”);</li> <li><strong>Forgive yourself:</strong> because you <em>will</em> fail from time to time, you have to learn to be kind to yourself, none of this is about perfection, it's about practice and trying to be better than before.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Avoid thinking in black and white -</strong> thinking in absolutes keeps us stuck in emotional immaturity, we need to practice understanding the shades of grey that make us human, people are fallible <em>and</em> trying their best, people can be selfish <em>and</em> selfless, people can be annoyed with you <em>and</em> love you, people can be very dumb and intelligent, it all depends on situation, who they're with, what has happened, and any other variables. Just like you.</li> <li><strong>Be patient -</strong> with yourself and others. </li> </ul> <p>This often happens best in therapy first, with affirmations, inner work, trauma therapy (especially if you dealt with neglect or emotional/physical abuse), then with friends/partners who model security.</p> <p>None of this isn't easy, I'm a work in progress that still struggles with reactivity <em>a lot,</em> but I'm doing my best, <em>patience</em> is the virtue that helps the most in all of this, it helps tolerate discomfort, hurt, accepting what I can't change, giving people second chances, among other things, but most of all it helps with giving me the grace to fall and get back up again as many times as needed.</p> <p>Good luck!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Siavon\"> /u/Siavon </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/attachment_theory/comments/1nxtawr/i_posted_a_while_ago_about_being_fearful_avoidant/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/attachment_theory/comments/1nxtawr/i_posted_a_while_ago_about_being_fearful_avoidant/\">[comments]</a></span>",
