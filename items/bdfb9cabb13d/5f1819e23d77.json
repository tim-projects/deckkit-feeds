  "description": "<div><p>With a lot of addictions, quitting at least feels like relief. With gambling, it feels like the opposite. When you stop, you’re left with huge debt, messed-up finances, and consequences that don’t go away just because you decided to quit.</p> <p>That’s what I’m dealing with right now. I want to stop, but every time I think about how much I owe, I get insanely stressed. I can’t just make that money appear, and the consequences feel overwhelming. That stress builds up so much that I end up gambling compulsively just to escape the feeling and forget about everything for a moment.</p> <p>It’s a brutal cycle. Even when you’re trying to do the right thing, the damage is still there, following you every day. People really underestimate how hard this makes quitting and staying clean.</p> <p>If anyone else is stuck in this loop, you’re not alone</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Intelligent_Draw_562\"> /u/Intelligent_Draw_562 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1q7nf2o/gambling_is_honestly_one_of_the_worst_addictions/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1q7nf2o/gambling_is_honestly_one_of_the_worst_addictions/\">[comments]</a></span>",
