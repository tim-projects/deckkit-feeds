  "description": "<div><p>Hello everyone! It's that time of the year again where I'll be away for a while.</p> <p>I really wanted to release the <a href=\"http://redd.it/1p74ypy\">Tasker RC</a> before Christmas, but I thought it would be a bit too risky because if anything goes wrong with the release I wouldn't be here to fix it.</p> <p>To compensate, I spent the past 3 days working on something that's cool by itself (at least IMO 😅) but can also be great for Tasker's future!</p> <p>Here's my gift to you:</p> <h1><a href=\"https://github.com/joaomgcd/ADBCommandCenter\">ADB Command Center</a></h1> <p>Here's a demo video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PSNmHfQ8BIY\">https://youtu.be/PSNmHfQ8BIY</a></p> <p>This new app allows you to seamlessly connect to ADB Wifi directly on your phone, <strong>without the need for a PC</strong> and then run shell commands with elevated privileges!</p> <p>This means that you can now easily do privileged stuff like <strong>toggle wifi</strong>, <strong>toggle bluetooth</strong>, <strong>enable/disable apps</strong>, and much more, without having to connect your phone to your PC first!</p> <p>It also automatically enables itself on reboot, as long as you're connected to Wifi and Wireless debugging is enabled in developer settings, so it should work seamlessly!</p> <p><strong>Important</strong>: It doesn't automatically enable Wireless Debugging on boot (I'm planning on adding that in the future), but if you want to, you can automate that with Tasker using the <strong>Custom Setting</strong> action: just use the helper there to find the correct setting, and it should work!</p> <h1>Open Source</h1> <p>The app is <strong>Open Source</strong>, and I've tried structuring the code in a way that makes it easy for anyone to add new modules. If you know how to code, be free to add stuff to it! Hopefully I've made it easy enough! 😅</p> <p>It currently has screens for:</p> <ul> <li>Run any ADB Shell command</li> <li>Toggle any app's permissions, including restricted stuff like <strong>WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS</strong> (eliminating the need for <a href=\"https://github.com/joaomgcd/Tasker-Permissions\">Tasker Permissions</a>)</li> <li>Install APKs, even those with lower Target APIs (you can now easily install <a href=\"https://github.com/joaomgcd/TaskerSettings\">Tasker Settings</a> if you want to)</li> </ul> <h1>Built-in Tasker Plugin</h1> <p>It also supports these 3 features through its Tasker plugin, so you can use them in your automations if you want to! :)</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: the app only works on Android 11+ because that's when Wireless Debugging was added to Android Settings. Also, it stops working if you disable Adb Wifi on your device. In the future I hope I can make it work like Shizuku, where it continues working even if Adb Wifi is disabled, so you just need to enable that to start the app and that's it!</p> <p>I've tested the app on multiple devices and it works well on all of them, so I hope it works for you too! I won't be here if it doesn't work, so fingers crossed! 😅</p> <p>In any case, happy Hollidays and I'll see you soon! Hope you enjoy this little gift! 😎</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> since everyone's feeling so holliday-y, maybe you can give my kids' new album a listen 😁! I'm sure they would appreciate it! If you do listen to the songs, let me know what you think. They are eager for anyone to comment on them 😅!</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/5TYJHqLQHZHnCvlrQrEL2n\">Spotify</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nOCz1fP1EOCitT1Y1W5SV-yQwu8DSoeRs\">YouTube Music</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/pt/album/queres-um-gelado/1854010364\">Apple Music</a></li> </ul> <p>A few highlights:</p> <h1>In your Dreams (I played drums on this one 😅)</h1> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/37ZPK1hV4zIeDHHcG5axJP?si=7ba151fd0e084c51\">Spotify</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=nxP9AWAnGQw&amp;si=WEzClwJChuDnD9PV\">YouTube Music</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/pt/song/in-your-dreams/1854010372\">Apple Music</a></li> </ul> <h1>War</h1> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/2GdJpYBZi6Gjzq8R025N6O?si=c33a4459fc4d4b41\">Spotify</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=fchmPG_ZQ0k&amp;si=TZgtlMgIuJ2UrwGE\">YouTube Music</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/pt/song/war/1854010369\">Apple Music</a></li> </ul> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/joaomgcd\"> /u/joaomgcd </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1pqi34p/dev_im_going_away_for_a_bit_but_heres_a_for_you/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1pqi34p/dev_im_going_away_for_a_bit_but_heres_a_for_you/\">[comments]</a></span>",
