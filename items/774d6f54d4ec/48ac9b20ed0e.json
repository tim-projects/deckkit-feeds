I'm back :)</p> <p>I've been away for a bit now and <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/FQBI8AQ.jpeg\">visited some very cool places</a> while I was gone, but now it's back to business as usual! 😁</p> <p>I do have over a 1000 requests to go through though, so please give me some time to catch up to everything. Don't be surprised if I'm not much around for the next week or 2.</p> <p>I did notice that the <a href=\"https://forum.joaoapps.com/index.php?resources/\">tutorial forums</a> are down at the moment, <strong>(EDIT: They're back now!)</strong> but I already figured out what's wrong and I'm working on a fix now. Hopefully I can get them back up tomorrow.</p> <p>Anyway, it's good to be back! 😀 Hopefully everything else went smoothly while I was away! Guess I'm about to find out... 😅</p> <p>Cheers!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/joaomgcd\"> /u/joaomgcd </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1nidaxv/dev_im_back_now_i_need_some_time_to_get_back_up/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1nidaxv/dev_im_back_now_i_need_some_time_to_get_back_up/\">[comments]</a></span>",
