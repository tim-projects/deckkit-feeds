For example, check out the <a href=\"https://redd.it/1lulpiq\">latest beta</a> if you're having trouble with Wifi Tethering on Android 16.</p> <h1>In the meantime, if you have any issues, check <a href=\"https://tasker.joaoapps.com/knownissues.html\">this list</a> and maybe your issue is listed there with a fix!</h1> <p>Cheers and see you soon!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/joaomgcd\"> /u/joaomgcd </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1mibgpd/dev_going_away_until_midseptember/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1mibgpd/dev_going_away_until_midseptember/\">[comments]</a></span>",
