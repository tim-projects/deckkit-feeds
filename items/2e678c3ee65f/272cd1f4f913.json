  "description": "<div><p>I'm potentially working for a startup over a 3 month period as a freelancer/consultant and the startup is asking me to download Vanta Agent onto my laptop for the duration of the period I work with them. </p> <p>This is so I comply with their ISO27001 cert. </p> <p>I'm not well informed on Vanta or these types of compliance softwares that potentially monitor what's on my laptop. </p> <p>Can anyone advise me on whether this is something I should be refusing? I don't really want to lose this client over this but also don't want them knowing everything I do on my laptop. </p> <p>Anyone had similar requests during their work?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Popal7\"> /u/Popal7 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1qbxszf/vanta_agent_for_a_freelancer/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1qbxszf/vanta_agent_for_a_freelancer/\">[comments]</a></span>",
