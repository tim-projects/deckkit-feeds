  "description": "<div><p>Burner account because I’m beyond embarrassed and absolutely pissed.</p> <p>I’m new to Upwork. First “client” I get sends me a Next.js project and says “just run it locally and see if it works.”</p> <p>They sent <strong>malware</strong>.</p> <p>And not sloppy malware. This was <em>deliberately hidden</em>.</p> <p>They buried heavily obfuscated JavaScript <strong>at the very bottom of</strong> nextjs.config.js, AFTER module.exports, under a massive wall of blank lines so you wouldn’t even scroll there. Like, this was 100% intentional.</p> <p>Once I actually de-obfuscated it, here’s what it was capable of:</p> <p>- Full file system access</p> <p>- Detecting the user’s home directory</p> <p>- Dynamically constructing file paths</p> <p>- Reading any file it had permission to read</p> <p>- Base64-encoding file contents (to hide what’s being sent)</p> <p>- Sending that data out via POST requests to remote servers</p> <p>Translation: <strong>if you ran it, assume your machine was compromised.</strong></p> <p>If you are new here:</p> <ul> <li>NEVER run client code blindly</li> <li>Obfuscated JS = malicious. There is no legit reason for it here.</li> <li>If a client says “just test it locally,” stop and think</li> </ul> <p>I’m posting this out of pure rage because I don’t want another new dev to learn this lesson the hard way like I did.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Jaded-Journalist2470\"> /u/Jaded-Journalist2470 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1q6omig/upwork_newbie_here_just_ran_straightup_malware/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1q6omig/upwork_newbie_here_just_ran_straightup_malware/\">[comments]</a></span>",
