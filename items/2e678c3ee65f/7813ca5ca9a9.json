  "description": "<div><p>Hi everyone, I just want to ask for some advice and perspective. I’m a 4th-year college student and I do web development as a side hustle. I already have a few student/organization clients, but this is my first time approaching a real business owner. There’s a guy I know personally (not close friends, but we know each other). He owns a construction/engineering business that’s doing pretty well. I noticed they don’t have a website, so I messaged him and politely offered my services, making it clear there was no pressure. He responded positively, asked about the price, looked at samples, and now we’re going to sit down and talk about it. Here’s where my anxiety kicks in 😅 Part of me worries: What if his business doesn’t really need a website? What if he’s just being nice because he knows me? Is it actually okay / professional to approach someone you know and offer freelance services? I wasn’t pushy and I genuinely believe a website could be useful as an official company profile, but I still feel awkward because this is my first time doing direct outreach like this. For experienced freelancers: Is this a normal way clients start? Is it ethical/professional to offer services to someone you know? Any advice on mindset when approaching potential clients like this? I’d really appreciate honest thoughts. Thanks 🙏</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Hot-Art-3967\"> /u/Hot-Art-3967 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1pwabla/is_it_okay_to_approach_someone_you_know_and_offer/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1pwabla/is_it_okay_to_approach_someone_you_know_and_offer/\">[comments]</a></span>",
