  "description": "<div><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>Like many of you, when I started looking for clients, I was overwhelmed by anecdotal advice: \"Just cold email,\" \"Use Upwork,\" \"Network in person.\" I wanted to know what actually works.</p> <p>So, I built a scraper to analyze the archives of <a href=\"/r/freelance\">r/freelance</a>, <a href=\"/r/upwork\">r/upwork</a>, <a href=\"/r/webdev\">r/webdev</a>, and several other freelance subreddits. I processed over 200,000 posts and comments, used AI to filter for relevant information, and normalized the data to find out exactly how people got their first client and how long it took.</p> <p>Here are the key findings from the data:</p> <ul> <li>In-Person is King (Speed-wise): The median time to land a client via In-Person Cold Outreach was just 1.5 days. It seems the \"uncomfortable\" work of showing up physically builds trust faster than anything else.</li> <li>The \"Cold\" Hierarchy: If you are doing cold outreach, the medium matters significantly: In-Person &gt; Cold Calling &gt; DMs &gt; Cold Emailing. Cold emailing was the least effective and slowest of the direct methods in the dataset.</li> <li>Free Work Works: Offering free work seems to be one of the fastest ways to convert to a paying client, likely because it removes the initial friction.</li> </ul> <p>Overall, the median time to find a first client was around 21 days, not bad at all!</p> <p>Methodology &amp; Data Constraints:</p> <p>While this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge the constraints of the data:</p> <ul> <li>Source Bias: Data is sourced from Reddit communities, which may skew towards specific types of freelancers and experiences.</li> <li>Self-Reporting: Timelines are based on user recollection, which can be subjective.</li> <li>Survivorship Bias: Successful freelancers are more likely to share their stories than those who did not find clients.</li> <li>Sample Size: While 4,000+ leads were identified, only ~1,000 contained explicit \"time to first client\" data.</li> </ul> <p>The archives I processed were from 2024. I am currently processing 2025 data and adding more subreddits, which should double or triple the number of leads and provide more accurate results.</p> <p>Full data if you want to look at it yourself : <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLCiQWlPsE3TXA7QE8I-oXyvR7Y1wfUOvj1G8289RmI/edit?usp=sharing\">Google Sheets</a></p> <p>I'm curious, does this match your experience? Did in-person outreach work faster for you than online methods?</p> <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Reverified some data today; the \"free work\" category had fewer datapoints than I thought, and the AI hallucinated a bit. Since it's \"free work,\" it didn't know whether it needed to find time until the first paying client or time until the first free client. I expect it to probably take a bit more time than 7 days and maybe <strong>bring in</strong> several clients at once.</p> <p>Also tried to look if a lot of spam got through (i.e., people just creating posts to advertise a product) and honestly, not a lot; I only saw one so far.</p> <p><strong>-&gt;</strong> Sadly, I can't update images. The conclusions still seem to be holding up at least—I hope it's not confirmation bias. I will let you know more for sure with the new data.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Tryhard_314\"> /u/Tryhard_314 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qaobz3\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1qaobz3/i_scraped_200k_reddit_posts_to_find_out_the_best/\">[comments]</a></span>",
