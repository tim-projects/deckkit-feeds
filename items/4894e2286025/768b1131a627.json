However, complications led us to a last-minute change: a public hospital in Ninh Thuan, the province where my wife grew up.</p> <p>​Upon arrival, I was immediately concerned. The facilities and equipment had a visibly bare-bones look and feel, a stark contrast to what I expected. ​Despite my initial worries, the experience was truly amazing. The doctors and support staff were nothing short of incredible. We received a high level of care and attentiveness that completely surpassed my expectations. </p> <p>​We received many different services and had an extended two-week stay, so I fully expected a hefty bill (10-15K USD) But when the final cost arrived, my jaw dropped. Our entire bill came to only around $700 USD. I was so stunned that I had to ask my wife three times if she was lying to me about the final cost.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/pioneer_206\"> /u/pioneer_206 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/1vtviqd6zfvf1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1o81hkj/my_jaw_dropped_when_i_saw_the_hospital_bill/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
