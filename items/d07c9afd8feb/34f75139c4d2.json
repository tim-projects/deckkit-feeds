  "description": "<div><p>Remote worker in Buenos Aires. Local currency is basically toilet paper at this point (sorry if that's harsh but you know). I get paid in usd but moving it here and spending it is a nightmare. Banks give terrible rates, crypto exchanges are sketchy, and paypal limits are a joke. Has anyone cracked the code on keeping value in dollars but still being able to tap and pay at the grocery store? Preferably without jumping through 15 hoops every time.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Long_Lie8296\"> /u/Long_Lie8296 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/1pytrxt/anyone_in_argentina_or_turkey_successfully/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/1pytrxt/anyone_in_argentina_or_turkey_successfully/\">[comments]</a></span>",
