  "description": "<div><p>I’ve had a few people ask me lately what I’m actually doing for work since I’ve been home more, so I figured I’d share a bit about my experience with Alignerr.</p> <p>I’ve been working as an AI Annotator for a while now, and it’s honestly been a relief to find something remote that’s actually legit. </p> <p>The biggest misconception I hear is that you need to be a coder or a tech genius to do this.</p> <p>The reality? I don’t touch a single line of code.</p> <p>I’m basically a human \"editor\" for AI. I read through responses it generates and help refine them so they’re more accurate and conversational. </p> <p>If you have a good handle on language and a sharp eye for detail, that’s really all the \"technical\" skill you need. They didn’t require any prior AI experience to get started, which was the big selling point for me.</p> <p>A few things I’ve appreciated so far:</p> <p><strong>Real Flexibility:</strong> I log on when it fits my schedule. No one is hovering over my shoulder.</p> <p>*<em>Low Barrier to Entry: *</em>You just take a skills assessment in your strongest subject (like writing or general knowledge) to get started.</p> <p>*<em>The Work Itself: *</em>It’s actually kind of interesting to see how the \"brain\" of an AI develops based on the feedback you give it.</p> <p>It’s been a great way to get into the tech space without having to go back to school for a CS degree. If you’re looking for something remote that’s flexible and straightforward, it’s definitely worth looking into.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Altair82\"> /u/Altair82 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/1q602l2/my_experience_working_online_with_alignerr/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/1q602l2/my_experience_working_online_with_alignerr/\">[comments]</a></span>",
