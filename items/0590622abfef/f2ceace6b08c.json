Here's my honest take on the life.\" /> </a>  <div><p>Been seeing a lot of \"is it worth it\" posts, so thought I'd share my 2 cents after 3 years here.</p> <p>It's not one \"community,\" it's a bunch of different scenes. You've got the hustle/party/influencer crowd in Canggu (which, honestly, I'm kinda over). You've got the yoga/wellness/spiritual crowd in Ubud. You've got the more settled, slower-paced expat/family vibe in Sanur (which is more my speed). There's a tribe for everyone here, you just gotta find 'em. Seriously, I've made some lifelong friends here, both local and foreign.</p> <p>The best part is when 5 PM rolls around. I shut my laptop, and instead of sitting in traffic, I'm on my scooter. 10 minutes later I can be surfing, at a warung, or grabbing a beer with friends on the beach. The work-life balance is insane.</p> <p>The best part is that Bali is just the base. You're not stuck here. My laptop in the pic is literally open to a Komodo trip. That's the part people miss. You're a short, cheap flight from Lombok, Sumba, Flores... all of it. Being a DN here means you can actually explore the rest of Indonesia on your weekends.</p> <p>It's not a perfect paradise. The traffic is insane, the visa runs are a pain, and it's gotten way more expensive. But at the end of the day, the good stuff still outweighs all that crap for me.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/ethanexplores\"> /u/ethanexplores </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/qdvmmhjhnd0g1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/southeastasia/comments/1ot71aw/been_a_dn_in_bali_for_3_years_heres_my_honest/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
