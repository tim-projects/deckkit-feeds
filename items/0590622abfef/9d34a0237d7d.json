My main takeaway is that this place is criminally underrated. I'm almost hesitant to post this because I don't want it to get blown up.</p> <p>I did a 5 day trip. The big reason I went was seeing pictures of Paisupok Lake. Let me just say, the pictures don't even do it justice. The water is this insane bright turquoise. It's not like anything I've ever seen. We just rented a little wooden boat and paddled around. It was dead silent and so clear you could see the bottom everywhere. That alone was worth the whole flight.</p> <p>The rest of the trip was just as good. We went to Piala Waterfall which is huge, like a proper jungle waterfall. And this place called Poganda Beach was a perfect white sand beach with literally no one else on it. Not a single person.</p> <p>It's not a super easy trip, I'll be honest. It's not Bali. You're not going to find a bunch of western cafes or beach clubs. This is a real adventure. You get muddy, you hike a bit, and the travel to get there takes time. But man, is it worth it.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/ethanexplores\"> /u/ethanexplores </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opqehq\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/southeastasia/comments/1opqehq/my_honest_review_of_luwuk_banggai_sulawesi/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
