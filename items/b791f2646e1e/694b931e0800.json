That's how it works.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Matt1y2\"> /u/Matt1y2 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/NFT/comments/1ptgdad/i_was_wrong_about_nfts/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/NFT/comments/1ptgdad/i_was_wrong_about_nfts/\">[comments]</a></span>",
