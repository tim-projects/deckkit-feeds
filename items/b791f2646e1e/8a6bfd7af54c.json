  "description": "<div><p>This is for my teenage son who started a trade on x with a user who seemed very legit, but this morning, my son's nft which is his life's savings and an important part of his mental health is gone and the new nft promised as a trade is not there. When I look at the humanity trade site, it is asking him to connect his wallet - BUT - if his wallet isn't connected, then how is his NFT gone? mastabeane on x somehow initiated this trade and he received the NFT and SOLD IT ALREADY, without his NFT going to my son's wallet. This was a mutant ape yacht club NFT. If you have any advice to give any recourse at all to help us, we greatly appreciate it. If this x user (mastabeane) contacts you - do not proceed. </p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/is-this-a-same-via-x-v0-54r30gzcxjdg1.png?width=2646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1135e8165d63234041ad38e17746c84813a52e65\"></a></p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/thejonesbrigade\"> /u/thejonesbrigade </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/NFT/comments/1qdv317/scammer_on_x_who_stole_nft_alert/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/NFT/comments/1qdv317/scammer_on_x_who_stole_nft_alert/\">[comments]</a></span>",
