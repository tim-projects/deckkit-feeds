  "description": "<div><p>The NFT market is down. Honestly, that doesn’t surprise me at all. The fact that people were willing to spend millions on a Twitter thread shows how irrational the market had become.</p> <p>Countless projects launched with big promises and roadmaps that were either naïve, poorly thought through, or simply absurd. A handful that managed to establish themselves as brands (and even there, it remains to be seen how long that lasts).</p> <p>That said, are there NFT projects flying under the radar that provide real utility to their holders? For example: access to locations, events, experiences, or other tangible benefits?</p> <p>Which NFTs can you actually use for something?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/LowFunction6798\"> /u/LowFunction6798 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/NFT/comments/1q354vi/after_the_nft_hype_which_nfts_actually_offer_real/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/NFT/comments/1q354vi/after_the_nft_hype_which_nfts_actually_offer_real/\">[comments]</a></span>",
