  "description": "<div><p>I joined this sub a few months back thinking it would be relevant to me, but it seems that it is 95% tech sales. </p> <p>I have worked in sales for the past 8 years selling premium engineering services and am moving on to a new role next week selling premium capital equipment to industry &amp; municipals etc. </p> <p>I feel like what I do is sales, but all I see on this sub is stuff about AE &amp; SDR &amp; SaaS etc and I have literally no idea what you are all on about with your abbreviations 😂 Seems to me that this really is a tech sales sub to support people that are out there cold calling and booking meetings for others etc. </p> <p>This post was half in jest, but also half serious - it may be worth changing the name 🤣</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/jw205\"> /u/jw205 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1q76847/petition_to_change_sub_name_to_tech_sales/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1q76847/petition_to_change_sub_name_to_tech_sales/\">[comments]</a></span>",
