The mushrooms have been growing well but only out the sides, and are already starting to hit the walls while being too young still to harvest. Can I cut the substrate in half long ways, and place the cut side down so the mushrooms can grow up instead? Will it harm the mushrooms if I cut through the substrate now?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/jewmaz\"> /u/jewmaz </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qicaic\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/1qicaic/can_i_cut_this_substrate_in_half_to_allow_the/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
