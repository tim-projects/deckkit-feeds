  "description": "<div><p>So ever since I've fully grasped what solipsism means and how it can't be disproven no matter what, it's starting to seriously affect me. I have no motivation to do anything. Literally. I have distanced myself from everyone, have no desire to speak to others, and when I do I feel so disconnected and like it's fake. I even called out of work today because last night was terrible, I woke up twice in the middle of the night having panic attacks regarding this philosophy. And all day today I've just sat on my couch and dont want to do anything else or see a point to do anything else. Its also kind of starting to affect I treat and act around others, like I feel like ive had less of a filter now since people may not be real. I dont like it and it scares me, but its like I cant ground myself. Im scared that I'm eventually going to have to either put myself in a hospital or even just commit suicide.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Spiritual-Try-5979\"> /u/Spiritual-Try-5979 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1qd05j4/solipsism_is_ruining_my_life_i_think_im_going/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1qd05j4/solipsism_is_ruining_my_life_i_think_im_going/\">[comments]</a></span>",
