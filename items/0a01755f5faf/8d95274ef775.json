  "description": "<div><p>He was skeptical about working with nomads. So I screenshared our last project handoff: designer in Bali finishing at 6pm wraps up, developer in Lisbon starting her morning picks it up immediately, I do the client review from Mexico before he's even awake in Chicago.</p> <p>He went quiet, then said \"wait, so you basically have a 16-hour workday without anyone actually working 16 hours?\"</p> <p>Exactly.</p> <p>The irony is that being in different time zones made us <em>more</em> responsive, not less. We built a follow-the-sun workflow that no office could match. Yeah, sometimes I'm on a call from a café with sketchy wifi, but I've also never missed a deadline because someone was \"stuck in traffic\" or \"out sick.\"</p> <p>Maybe reliability isn't about being at a desk from 9-5. It's about actually showing up when you say you will, wherever you are.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/RaspJur\"> /u/RaspJur </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1q9cmkh/a_client_said_how_can_you_be_reliable_when_youre/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1q9cmkh/a_client_said_how_can_you_be_reliable_when_youre/\">[comments]</a></span>",
