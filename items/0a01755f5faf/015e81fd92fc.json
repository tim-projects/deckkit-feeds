  "description": "<div><p>Which country surprised you the most when you visited? Maybe it wasn’t high on your list, or you went in with no expectations and left genuinely impressed. </p> <p>My pick is Romania. I expected pretty scenery and cheap prices, but I didn’t expect how varied it felt. Medieval towns, wild nature, great food, and a pace that made traveling feel easy instead of rushed. It quietly became one of my favorite trips.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Airalo_Dani\"> /u/Airalo_Dani </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1q3rid5/whats_the_most_underrated_country_youve_visited/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1q3rid5/whats_the_most_underrated_country_youve_visited/\">[comments]</a></span>",
