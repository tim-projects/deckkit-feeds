My first ever clone run produced 2786.4 g wet between two tubs. I decided to try out the north spore boomer tub for fun and it did not disappoint. Some notable things from this grow were that I got my first siamese mushroom, my biggest mushroom at 46.3 grams which is picture 6, and biggest yield from 1 flush in 1 tub. Im definitely continuing this clone run to improve it. Like always if you have any questions, feel free to ask!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Nervous-Ad-9276\"> /u/Nervous-Ad-9276 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qft4zj\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/unclebens/comments/1qft4zj/first_clone_run_ever/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
