  "description": "<div><p>Currently seeking out a business coach that has demonstrated success working with individuals to develop small business income streams. I am not looking for online influencers, course creators, Amazon drop shipping or blogging - but other online business experience is ok. I need someone who can share success examples so I can evaluate if their coaching would align with my specific need. Does anyone know where I could find this type of coach?</p> <p>Edit: These businesses are very early stages, not income generating yet but I have the base established. Interested in coaching to determine the right activities for the right stage and how to measure success and/or know when to shift growth efforts or activities I'd be open to spending up to $5-10K on a coach if well justified. </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/IceUpstairs\"> /u/IceUpstairs </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/lifecoaching/comments/1q1z9qn/how_to_find_a_business_coach/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/lifecoaching/comments/1q1z9qn/how_to_find_a_business_coach/\">[comments]</a></span>",
