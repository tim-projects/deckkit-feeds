  "description": "<div><p>Every person on the planet who's able to walk has done multiple things that are cringe at some point in their lives. </p> <p>That's the bad news of being a human </p> <p>The good news is none of them killed you. </p> <p>And none will kill you moving forward. </p> <p>But not being prepared to embarrass yourself from time to time may kill your chances of becoming a fully booked coach, keeping you ensconced in your comfort zone. </p> <p>Comfort zones are nice, but you can't appreciate how nice somewhere is until you leave it from time to time, and you get the thrill of returning. </p> <p>Make 2026 the time you publish some content that makes you feel vulnerable. Record a video on a bad hair day. Or get up to talk in front of an audience, even though you feel like you may hurl on the front row. </p> <p>You will almost certainly be glad you did.</p> <p>And if you do die of embarrassment, I'll be the first to apologise to your loved ones for the terrible advice I gave you. </p> <p>Happy New Year coach!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/TheAngryCoach\"> /u/TheAngryCoach </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/lifecoaching/comments/1q0hzkm/nobody_ever_died_of_embarrassment/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/lifecoaching/comments/1q0hzkm/nobody_ever_died_of_embarrassment/\">[comments]</a></span>",
