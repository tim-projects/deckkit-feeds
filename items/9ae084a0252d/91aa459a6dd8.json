  "description": "<div><p>I’ll be honest, I was a skeptic about using ChatGPT for coaching because I thought it would make everything feel robotic. But I’ve started using specific prompts just for the administrative side like summarizing intake notes and drafting client acquisition emails and it’s saved me hours. It’s helped me get more organized with my leads without losing the personal touch. How are you guys using AI without it feeling like you're \"phoning it in\"? I’ve got a couple of prompts that are working well if anyone wants to swap ideas.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/No-Blood1055\"> /u/No-Blood1055 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/lifecoaching/comments/1q59l58/im_finally_using_ai_for_the_boring_parts_of/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/lifecoaching/comments/1q59l58/im_finally_using_ai_for_the_boring_parts_of/\">[comments]</a></span>",
