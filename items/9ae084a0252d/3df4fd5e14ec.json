  "description": "<div><p>I work with a lot of life coaches now, and I want to share something I really wish someone had explained earlier because it’s the thing I see holding most great coaches back.</p> <p>Most coaches I meet are highly skilled and genuinely good at what they do. They get their clients results. But when it comes time to get more clients and scale to that next level in their business and with their money, it's a struggle.</p> <p>The hard truth is, people don’t hire coaches because they want “coaching.” </p> <p>They hire because your message makes them believe <em>you</em> understand their problem better than anyone else and that you have a clear way to solve it.</p> <p>That belief is built in how you talk about yourself, how you describe your work, and how consistently that message shows up everywhere you’re visible.</p> <p>This is why mastering your messaging is one of the most cost-effective and impactful ways to grow a coaching business. When your message is clear, it attracts the right people over and over again without constant pitching or explaining yourself in DMs. </p> <p>It becomes an evergreen funnel where, aligned, dream clients find you already convinced you’re the right fit.</p> <p>A few things I wish more coaches understood:</p>  <li><p>Get specific about <em>who you help, how you do it, and why</em>.<br /> “I help people step into their best life” sounds nice, but it doesn’t give someone a reason to choose you. Your ideal client should immediately know, “This is for me.” And that specificity builds trust faster than credentials ever will. </p></li> <li><p>Your process matters more than your title.<br /> Life coach, mindset coach, transformation coach etc, none of that differentiates you. What <em>does</em> differentiate you is how you approach the problem and what makes your method work. That’s what people are actually buying.</p></li> <li><p>Clarity creates confidence, for you and your clients.<br /> When your message is clear, you stop second-guessing yourself. You stop over-explaining. And the people who find you come in aligned instead of needing convincing.</p></li>  <p>If I had to simplify this into 3 things you can do today, it would be this:</p>  <li>Rewrite how you explain what you do in one sentence. No buzzwords or extra fluff, just the problem you solve and who it’s for.</li> <li>Choose one core problem you want to be known for and let everything point back to that.</li> <li>Start sharing <em>why</em> your approach works and what you believe most people get wrong about this problem.</li>  <p>When your messaging is dialed in, traffic follows.<br /> When traffic follows, clients stop feeling hard to find.</p> <p>Hope this helps a coach who’s great at what they do but tired of struggling to explain it.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Bthemanifestor\"> /u/Bthemanifestor </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/lifecoaching/comments/1pywf48/here_is_how_to_get_more_clients_as_a_coach/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/lifecoaching/comments/1pywf48/here_is_how_to_get_more_clients_as_a_coach/\">[comments]</a></span>",
