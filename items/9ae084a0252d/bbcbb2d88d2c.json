  "description": "<div><p>I see some posts and ads on this topic, both good and bad. It's interesting to see online coaches be able to bring in this clientele, and be good at this craft.</p> <p>Personally, I have had sessions with these coaches to be a better coach, and honestly I was able to improve as a coach by drawing my inspiration and practice from other sources such as philosophy readings, mindset readings, and interactions with other people in my personal and business life.</p> <p>Not to discredit these coaches, they are quite good at their craft. But what are your opinions about this?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Slight-Signature1141\"> /u/Slight-Signature1141 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/lifecoaching/comments/1puooqr/coaches_coaching_other_coaches_on_how_to_better/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/lifecoaching/comments/1puooqr/coaches_coaching_other_coaches_on_how_to_better/\">[comments]</a></span>",
