  "description": "<div><p>I just spontaneously decided to stand completely still in front of my mirror after a cold shower, breathe slowly and stare blankly at my face for about 10 minutes straight. After about 3 minutes my reflection kept changing faces?? I looked angry then I blinked and looked sad. (Bear in mind my face remained neutral irl throughout). After that parts of my face started to disappear and become plain skin, my face became elongated to where my mouth was pretty much situated on my neck. My eyes changed shape, multiple faces were layered ontop of each other at some point and different expressions with warped alien faces looked back at me. </p> <p>I decided to have a cold shower and do some breathing because I felt like I was going to have a panic attack (had racing heart, butterflies etc), now I feel super at peace and calm but really freaked out.</p> <p>Idk if this counts as meditation or what but I just thought it was cool to tell someone and know if anyone else has done something similar?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/CrustyToes6422\"> /u/CrustyToes6422 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1q14pfn/what_the_actual_hell/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1q14pfn/what_the_actual_hell/\">[comments]</a></span>",
