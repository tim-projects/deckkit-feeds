  "description": "<div><p>Been meditating for quite a while and apparently I was doing it wrong by trying to push thoughts and emotions away. So I just decided to concentrate while letting emotions and thoughts come and do whatever on the side no matter how uncomfortable it was and it made me realize they are just part of our mind and body and just doing their job just like your heart is beating. It’s up to me to decide what thought or emotion should I listen to and ignore whatever is pointless. I think that is what brings peace.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/TripSuspicious\"> /u/TripSuspicious </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1q2s889/just_realized_meditation_is_basically_willing_to/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1q2s889/just_realized_meditation_is_basically_willing_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",
