  "description": "<div><p>Here’s something that genuinely surprised me:</p> <p>From a medical perspective, the nervous system can get so used to stress that it starts treating it as a baseline state. Elevated heart rate, shallow breathing, constant alertness, they stop feeling unusual, even though the body is still under strain.</p> <p>When I started meditating, I thought it would calm me down. Instead, it made me <em>notice</em> how activated my body already was, tight chest, fast breath, subtle tension everywhere.</p> <p>That awareness itself is important. Research shows that simply noticing bodily sensations activates brain regions involved in regulation and reduces automatic stress responses over time.</p> <p>So meditation isn’t always about becoming calm in the moment. Sometimes it’s the first time the body realizes it’s been stressed all along.</p> <p>Did anyone else experience meditation as revealing stress rather than instantly relieving it?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/theshroomgroove\"> /u/theshroomgroove </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1q89f4x/your_brain_treats_stress_as_normal_meditation/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1q89f4x/your_brain_treats_stress_as_normal_meditation/\">[comments]</a></span>",
