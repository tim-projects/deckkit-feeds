  "description": "<div><p>Hello, I don't know if this is necessarily existentialist and correct me if it isn't. What I've realized is that death is a transition between living and not living.. and I don't know if that's the whole spiritual truth about death. I just really want to know what you guys think.. I just feel really sad knowing that death is a wonderful moment where you get to relive everything for a split second and feel love.. just to die. It's in the meaningless stuff we do that we create meaning. :)</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Left_Illustrator_704\"> /u/Left_Illustrator_704 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/1qg493a/death/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/1qg493a/death/\">[comments]</a></span>",
