  "description": "<div><p>When people say, \"I am doing this because I have no other choice,\" it's more of a decision heuristic, a pragmatic elimination of all other costly choices.</p> <p>It doesn't always mean Sartrean bad faith. It's not always disclaimer of freedom and responsibility.</p> <p>Rather, the individual has immediately found the path/choice of least resistance and does not waste energy trying to weigh all other options.</p> <p>It's an efficient decision heuristic. A father who needs to foot the bill for his child's school project will say this. He could choose not to but he has already committed to supporting his child's education -- so \"I have no choice.\" He doesn't need to bear the mental burden of freedom and responsibility every breakfast.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/blitzballreddit\"> /u/blitzballreddit </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/1qfyjz3/i_have_no_choice_is_a_decision_heuristic_its_not/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/1qfyjz3/i_have_no_choice_is_a_decision_heuristic_its_not/\">[comments]</a></span>",
