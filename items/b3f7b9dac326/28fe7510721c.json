  "description": "<div><p>I feel like whenever people try and explain the body of the universe like the Big Bang or multiverse theory I just sit and nod but then I’m like, what the fuck happened before that and what happened before that to think that there could be a before that. This is probably a VERY basic thought but oh my god does it blow my little brain. Like we are on earth in a galaxy in a universe but the universe is just a word made up by humans, we actually don’t know anything at all everything is so theoretical it makes me go insane. I don’t know how people could work their whole lives studying the universe and space I would go textbook crazy. I’m not what I’d say “new” to existentialism because I’ve always since I was like 5 had Apeirophobia (fear of eternity) which sends me into straight panic attacks sometimes lol </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/raspberritea\"> /u/raspberritea </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/1qd4dq0/just_what_is_anything/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/1qd4dq0/just_what_is_anything/\">[comments]</a></span>",
