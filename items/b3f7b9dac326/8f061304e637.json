  "description": "<div><p>I'm gonna be honest. I never really understood the point of The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus. The main idea I got, but I was totally ignorant to the deeper meaning until today. </p> <p>Obviously, Sisyphus' punishment is pushing the boulder up the hill. I always thought that alluded to the daily task of getting up and providing, but I finally see what it actually means. The philosophy newsletter I read just finished a whole week on existentialism and ended it with Camus.</p> <p>The author goes, \"His power isn’t in hope, but in awareness. He knows that the task is endless, but still returns to it.\" ...and then goes on to say \"the struggle itself is enough to fill a human heart.\"</p> <p>Have a read. I feel it does Camus a lot of justice for people like me who tend to see the surface of things more than the deeper meaning:<br /> <a href=\"https://thought-breakfast.beehiiv.com/p/camus-the-courage-to-push\">https://thought-breakfast.beehiiv.com/p/camus-the-courage-to-push</a></p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/marketaurelius\"> /u/marketaurelius </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/1qehhi6/i_finally_understand_the_meaning_behind_sisyphus/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/1qehhi6/i_finally_understand_the_meaning_behind_sisyphus/\">[comments]</a></span>",
