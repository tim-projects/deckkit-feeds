  "description": "<div><p>F28 is showing up on my Hub Max this morning and was not there yesterday. Google is sticking to its regular schedule. I didn't notice any changes with a quick smoke test. No release notes yet, but I'll update as soon as I see them. If you find them first, please let me know.</p> <p>Obviously, these Fuchsia updates are more backend, but I'd love to see the ability to uninstall apps.</p> <p>Update - <a href=\"https://fuchsia.dev/whats-new/release-notes/f28\">Here are the release notes</a>.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Competitive_Ad_255\"> /u/Competitive_Ad_255 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Fuchsia/comments/1o1dobx/f28_released/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Fuchsia/comments/1o1dobx/f28_released/\">[comments]</a></span>",
