  "description": "<div><p>I hate the spoon theory. Not the theory itself, but the use of spoons as a metaphor. </p> <p>I just don't get it. Why spoons? Where did this come from? It feels like such a random object to try and explain the theory it's relating to. I honestly think it's a stupid way to try and explain this phenomenon. </p> <p>I think a much better metaphor is a bucket of water. Each day you have a bucket of water representing how much energy you have. Now each day you have various tasks to do requiring a certain amount of water to complete the task, and for some they require more than others. </p> <p>Feel like this works better especially in relation to adhd as it can explain the way medication works really well. Medication doesn't increase the amount if water (energy) you have available, what it does is decreases the amount of water needed to complete a task. But the key part there is you still need some water to actually do the task, its doesn't make it so that no effort is required at all. Medication simply lowers the energy threshold required to do said task, overall making it easier and leaving you more energy leftover for other things. </p> <p>This is just a silly rant but I just want to yell this into the void as it low key pmo so much 😅</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Delicious_Volume7183\"> /u/Delicious_Volume7183 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1qhp6yy/maybe_an_unpopular_opinion_i_hate_the_spoon_theory/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1qhp6yy/maybe_an_unpopular_opinion_i_hate_the_spoon_theory/\">[comments]</a></span>",
