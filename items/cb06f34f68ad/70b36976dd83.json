  "description": "<div><p>I’ve been doing OE for almost 5 years now. I’ve paid off debt, taken on more debt, paid that off again, relaxed, burned out, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/1fve5vw/i_quit_j3_and_they_offered_me_more_money/\">quit</a>...you name it.</p> <p>One thing I’ve learned along the way is that some skills are way more valuable than others, at least from upper management perspective.</p> <p>I’ve never been the smartest person in the room or the top performer. But I consider I am good at communicating. For example in daily standups, I focus on being clear and getting straight to the point. While some people spend minutes rambling what they’re doing and how they’re doing it, I usually need one or two sentences and that's it.</p> <p>I honestly didn’t realize how valuable that was until OE. You don’t have to be the best. If you can clearly explain what you’re doing, what’s blocked, and what’s next, people assume you’re on top of things and leave you alone.</p> <p>Clear communication goes a long way.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/orellabak\"> /u/orellabak </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/1qdnxth/the_one_skill_they_value_the_most/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/1qdnxth/the_one_skill_they_value_the_most/\">[comments]</a></span>",
