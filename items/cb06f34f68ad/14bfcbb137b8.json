  "description": "<div><p>A (now former) coworker was caught this week and it was very dramatic. </p> <p>Big talker, under producer. Hired several years ago and I immediately suspected OE because on several calls I could hear other calls in the background and a lot of muting/camera gymnastics.</p> <p>I believe it’s when he got up to J3/J4 which got him caught since they were all in the same industry.</p> <p>He went to a conference repping J2 and was seen by the executive team at J1 put in his resignation and then J3 posted his picture and new role announcement on LinkedIn and tagged J1 (they thought it was his former employer… this post went out BEFORE he resigned and indicated he had already started).🫣</p> <p>So now everyone at J1 is talking. J3 since took down the LinkedIn post. Not sure if this will kill his reputation or cost him the other jobs.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Hot-Radish-9723\"> /u/Hot-Radish-9723 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/1qfgf7v/coworker_caught/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/1qfgf7v/coworker_caught/\">[comments]</a></span>",
