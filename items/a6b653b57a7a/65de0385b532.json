  "description": "<div><p>Got this from my old gymnastic guy.</p> <p>Instead of watching the clock during hollow holds or planks or L sit attempts, i count slow exhales. one deep breath in, slow breath out, that's one. shoot for ten breaths instead of thirty seconds or whatever.</p> <p>so the difference is it forces me to actually breathe instead of holding my breath. now my holds last longer because of focus on the breathing rhythm instead of seeing seconds ticks.</p> <p>Also makes progression dead simple. Once ten breaths feels manageable, I aim for twelve. No stopwatch needed, just me and my lungs figuring it out together.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/ContactCold1075\"> /u/ContactCold1075 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1qchd19/stopped_counting_reps_and_started_counting_breaths/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1qchd19/stopped_counting_reps_and_started_counting_breaths/\">[comments]</a></span>",
