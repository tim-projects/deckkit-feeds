  "description": "<div><p>I’ve always wanted to get into fitness, but I’ve never had the dedication to keep up the momentum, untill I’ve started to jump rope. </p> <p>I’ve been going a little over a month at this point and seen dramatic improvement. I could barely get one jump at first, now I can get five consecutive sets for two minutes each. </p> <p>I’ve always heard the idea that the best exercise is the one that you enjoy, but jumping rope is the first one I’ve found that I can stay consistent at. It’s way easier logistically, and physically (for beginners) than running. And less time consuming than getting more than 10k steps. </p> <p>That’s all lol. I’m just surprised how much I like jumping rope.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/pepe_dafroggo\"> /u/pepe_dafroggo </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1q34bte/jumping_rope_is_awesome/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1q34bte/jumping_rope_is_awesome/\">[comments]</a></span>",
