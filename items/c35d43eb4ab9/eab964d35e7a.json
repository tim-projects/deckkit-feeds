  "description": "<div><p>yall this is the best my nails have looked in all my life, I’m 24 and I’ve bitten and tore my nails and cuticles up since I was like 5-6 in elementary school :( I started putting nail hardener on my nails and then using HELLA cuticle oils and creams. I used to have deep red and raw wounds on my cuticles and I used to be so embarrassed of people seeing them :( when I had super raw wounds I would let them dry out and then put lots of A&amp;D ointment or aquaphor on my cuticles, and I noticed my skin starting healing and getting softer. I would challenge myself to not pick or bite and I started seeing little bits of growth and my cuticles started healing toooooo omg guys I can’t believe it honestly even my family and friends are surprised to see my nails in this condition cause this is not how they ever look. they still look a little red and swollen, but they are getting better! I could just cryyyyyy, you guys we can do itttt I promise I have been a secret follower of this page and I never thought I would make a post cause no matter how hard I tried I could never break the habit, but this time I DID IT AHHHHHHH I can’t even believe it :) ok byeeee </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/baybeevangee\"> /u/baybeevangee </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/0apt25gqnmdg1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/calmhands/comments/1qe4hul/war_is_overr/\">[comments]</a></span>",
