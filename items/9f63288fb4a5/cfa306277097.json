  "description": "<div><p>I know this might be a controversial take, but I feel like the community has over-mystified the \"purge\" to a point that ignores basic biology and history.</p> <p>The Historical Context: Parasites</p> <p>Historically, purging served a very practical, medicinal purpose. In the Amazon, indigenous populations often dealt with high loads of intestinal parasites. The emetic properties of the vine were a literal \"spring cleaning\" for the gut. In that context, purging was a physical necessity for health.</p> <p>The Modern Reality: Tannins vs. Emotions</p> <p>Today, we love to say we are \"vomiting up childhood trauma\" or \"purging dark energy.\" While the psychological release of surrendering to the medicine is real, the physical act of vomiting is largely a reaction to tannins.</p> <p>Ayahuasca is incredibly high in tannins (the same astringent compounds found in over-steeped tea or wine, but at much higher concentrations). These are notorious for:</p> <p>• Irritating the gastric lining.</p> <p>• Binding to proteins in your stomach.</p> <p>• Triggering a strong emetic response.</p> <p>When your body tries to expel these harsh compounds, it feels violent and \"deep.\" Because we are in a heightened psychedelic state, our brains assign a narrative to that discomfort. We feel \"bad\" (the tannins), then we vomit, then we feel \"good\" (the relief of nausea subsiding and endorphins rushing in). We then label that relief as \"clearing out bad energy.\"</p> <p>Is the Glorification Counterproductive?</p> <p>By glorifying the purge as the only way to heal, I think we:</p>  <li><p>Create unnecessary anxiety for newcomers.</p></li> <li><p>Discount the experiences of those who don't purge but still have profound shifts.</p></li> <li><p>Ignore the physical toll that repeated, violent vomiting takes on the body (dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, esophageal irritation).</p></li>  <p>I’m not saying there isn't a \"letting go\" aspect to it, but maybe it’s time we acknowledge that we’re mostly just reacting to a very bitter, tannin-heavy brew rather than literally \"puking out demons.\"</p> <p>What are your thoughts? Has the \"purge\" become a bit of a spiritual trope?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/beezdaak\"> /u/beezdaak </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/1qhyh3y/can_we_talk_about_the_glorification_of_purging/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/1qhyh3y/can_we_talk_about_the_glorification_of_purging/\">[comments]</a></span>",
