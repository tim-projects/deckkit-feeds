  "description": "<div><p>Have you ever found yourself feeling as though you are suddenly leaving your physical body, able to move freely, perceive the world around you from a perspective outside of yourself, or even observe your <em>own</em> body from above? Out-of-body experiences can occur in a variety of different contexts—deliberately induced, spontaneously, or even as an aspect of a near-death experience—and they offer fascinating insights into the nature of our consciousness.</p> <p>As an undergraduate student at King’s University College in Canada studying out-of-body experiences, I’m inviting individuals who have had <strong>at least one out-of-body experience</strong> in their lifetime to participate in my research study. By sharing your experience, you can help expand our understanding of this phenomenon. If you are interested, please follow the attached link and take some time to fill out my survey. Any contribution is greatly appreciated.</p> <p>Thank you for helping me explore the extraordinary!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/emmnardz\"> /u/emmnardz </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5znl6bgsNfsNSgS\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Astreality/comments/1qcwjb9/opportunity_to_participate_in_research_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",
