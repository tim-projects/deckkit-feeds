Probably close to three hours, maybe more. Then I felt something physical inside my body. A quick “surge” of energy in a small highly concentrated form which felt as if something “dropped” inside the center of my body. Cognitively it was as if something switched off and then something switched on rapidly. I was feeling pulled into a deeper dreaming state. Cognitive transition of some kind. Weird. The first part was when I noticed my left hand was surrounded by a intense luminous purple cloud a bit larger than my hand. Curiously since it was dark only a moment before it was dark I couldn’t see anything. Earlier I had seen the purplish fog but that was less intense and I couldn’t see anything else at time except the purple fog. </p> <p>What happened next is a little too hard to describe or create since I don’t have the AI skills to illustrate. plus things were speeding up. </p> <p>The above event happened a couple of months ago. Last weekend the same kind of shift centered or felt inside my body and a downward shift occurred. Quickly with the dreaming energy surging like before. </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Ok-Glass70\"> /u/Ok-Glass70 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/i34qr8kvwqdg1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/1qem6j7/purple/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
