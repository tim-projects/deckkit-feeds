Death. Rebirth. Death…</p> <p>As the kabbalistic tree of life would portray through some of the various sephiroths, severity and mercy. </p> <p>I feel like for the Jung peeps, I don’t need to explain too much further…but how interesting is this to ponder??</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Sevilachaote\"> /u/Sevilachaote </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/08afiwh8pq7g1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1pot1d3/as_above_so_below_a_concept_embraced_by_jung_and/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
