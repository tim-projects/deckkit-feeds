The robot itself runs on two So-101 units, which I control using two additional So-101s. On the software side, I’m using Phosphobot’s program to handle everything. For those curious about the head and control system: it’s based on a design by YouTuber MaxImagination, originally intended for RC cars — I described it in more detail in my last post. The arms are still a bit shaky, and the robot tends to swing, which makes the camera feed a little shaky as well — but those are problems for another time. I’ll keep you posted with further progress!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Parking_Commission60\"> /u/Parking_Commission60 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://v.redd.it/h1xkc5el60of1\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1nbzdhw/teleoperating_my_robot/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
