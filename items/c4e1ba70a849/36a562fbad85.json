  "description": "<div><p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunggal_panaluan\">wikipedia</a>: A tunggal panaluan is a magic staff used by shamans of the Batak people, who live in the highlands of North Sumatra, Indonesia. Traditionally the tunggal panaluan is made from wood of a specific tree and carved with human figures and embellished with horsehair and <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">cooked human brain</span>, <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">both procured from sacrificial victims</span>.</p> <p>Tunggal panaluan was carved out of the wood of Cassia javanica, the only tree from which the tunggal panaluan can be created. The tree occupies a central place in the ancestral myth of the Batak people, as well as the figures depicted on the tunggal panaluan. Tunggal panaluan was carved with human and animal figures arranged above each other. The human figure refers to a Batak myth that tells of incestuous twins. Animals found depicted in the tunggal panaluan include snakes, dragons, geckos and water buffaloes. Another type of magic staff, known as the tunggal malehat, depicts a human riding either a horse or a mythical beast.</p> <p>The tunggal panaluan was used in ceremonies to ward off disaster and illness as well as to cause them.\"</p> <p><strong>NSFW tag is due to the nature of how the staff is made</strong>. </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/SibyllaAzarica\"> /u/SibyllaAzarica </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/q0ytiv86sieg1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Shamanism/comments/1qi3nla/tunggal_panaluan_magic_staff_used_by_batak_shamans/\">[comments]</a></span>",
