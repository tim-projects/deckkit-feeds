Historically, many shamans have eked out at least part of their living by getting involved in feuds, and there can be darker aspects to the practice:\"</p> <p>Worth pointing out that, in many shamanic cultures (which obviously also exist outside of the Americas and Siberia) there is no such thing as \"lightwork\" or a battle of good and evil. There is only creation and destruction and both are necessary, respected forces that are worked with on a regular basis. Abrahamic dogma and concepts such as 'white magick vs black magick' have no place in these traditions. There is only magick.</p> <p>Further down the article, another hard truth: \"Amazonian shamans are often received as royalty within monied communities the world over, with ayahuasca seen as a one-stop shop to healing and transcendence, and an escape from the drudgery of modern life.\"</p> <p>Sadly, no one thinks they're at risk for getting sucked into a cult, until they're stuck in one.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/SibyllaAzarica\"> /u/SibyllaAzarica </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/roger-bardales-ayahuasca-abuse-allegations-cult/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Shamanism/comments/1qfklin/this_peruvian_shaman_became_a_popstar_now_hes/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
