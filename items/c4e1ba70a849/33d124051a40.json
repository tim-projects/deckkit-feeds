  "description": "<div><p>I see a lot of posts that say these things are a required part of journey work, but that is only true of some cultures. Underworld work like this is well documented since at least the time of the cradle of civilization. Although divine plants and drums are an integral part of my tradition, when we work in the underworld and other realms, we use none of these and prefer to enter trance in other ways.</p> <p>How do you journey? If you do use the more commonly-known tools, what do you use?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/SibyllaAzarica\"> /u/SibyllaAzarica </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Shamanism/comments/1qebsqn/who_else_journeys_without_drugs_drums_rattles_etc/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Shamanism/comments/1qebsqn/who_else_journeys_without_drugs_drums_rattles_etc/\">[comments]</a></span>",
