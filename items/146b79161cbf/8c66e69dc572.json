I started working on myself just a few months ago (as you can already see), and so I made this setup (or whatever you call it). It works beautifully for me. I know the quality of the images is bad. I will upload again after I get it right.</p> <p>Here are the entire setup details.</p> <p>Theme: <a href=\"https://github.com/nickberckley/kabadoni\">Kabadoni</a></p> <p>Plugins (active only):</p> <p>- Advanced Tables</p> <p>- Banners</p> <p>- Book Search</p> <p>- Calendar</p> <p>- Checkbox Style Menu</p> <p>- CSS Editor</p> <p>- Dashboard navigator</p> <p>- Dataview</p> <p>- Easy Typing</p> <p>- Heatmap Calendar</p> <p>- Hider</p> <p>- Highlightr</p> <p>- Homepage</p> <p>- Kanban</p> <p>- Latex Suite</p> <p>- Linter</p> <p>- Minimal Theme Settings</p> <p>- Multi Properties</p> <p>- Numerals</p> <p>- PDF++</p> <p>- Pixel Banner</p> <p>- Pretty Properties</p> <p>- Ranked Habit Tracker</p> <p>- SideNote</p> <p>- Style Settings</p> <p>- TaskNotes</p> <p>- Tasks</p> <p>- Theme Toggler</p> <p>Ranked Habit Tracker is a plugin that I recently created and have submitted for review. If you still want to try it, then you can search Baldev8910/Ranked-Habit-Tracker. I can't paste the link because GitHub is not working for me (currently).</p> <p>I have sourced wallpapers from <a href=\"https://wallhaven.cc/\">WallHaven</a>. You can find really great wallpapers there.</p> <p>If you have any questions, let me know.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/-S-S_Sympathizer\"> /u/-S-S_Sympathizer </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pup4r8\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1pup4r8/my_obsidian_setup/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
