How should I organize my files and which plugins should I use?” For God’s sake, I honestly do not understand why new users are so unwilling to read older posts.</p> <p>I do understand when someone has a very specific situation, for example “I am a PhD student and I do X and Y.” That is fine and makes sense. But the generic posts I mentioned earlier are slowly turning into noise and cluttering the subreddit.</p> <p>I think it would be a great idea to create a single post where everyone can share how they use Obsidian, which plugins they rely on, and what advice they would give to beginners. If this post gets enough attention, it could really help new users by giving them solid guidance and motivation and, in the end, make our community stronger!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/asteroid_annihilator\"> /u/asteroid_annihilator </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/qfgwvf9hj9eg1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qgya44/ultimate_guide_on_how_to_use_obsidian_for_new/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
