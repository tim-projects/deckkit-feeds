  "description": "<div><p>I'm a 15-Year-Old who got into Anarchism around a year ago, and since then I got a lot into Theory when I found out about the Anarchist Library, I started out with the more \"Classical\" side of Anarchism and then started getting into the \"Contemporary\" (Post-Anarchist/Post-Left) kinds of Anarchism.</p> <p>So far, I have read Kropotkin's *The Conquest Of Bread* and *The State: Its Historic Role,* Malatesta's *Anarchy,* Todd May's *The Political Philosophy of Post-Structuralist Anarchism,* Saul Newman's *The Politics of Post-Anarchism* and *Post-Anarchism,* Foucault's *The Subject and Power,* Bob Black's *The Abolition of Work,* the Invisible Committee's *The Coming Insurrection,* Jacques Ellul's *Anarchy &amp; Christianity,* multiple Works of Tiqqun (*Introduction to Civil War, Theses On The Imaginary Party* and *This Is Not A Program*), Wayne Price's *Marx's Economics for Anarchists,* Gilles Dauvé's *Eclipse and Re-Emergence of the Communist Movement,* and I even stumbled into Nyx Land's *Hello From The Wired,* though Cyber-Nihilism didnt get much interest from me compared to the other Works.</p> <p>In any case where these Works had concepts I was unfamiliar with, I got to inform myself on said concepts first.</p> <p>Right now I'm reading Guy Debord's *The Society of The Spectacle.* I plan to keep up with reading Theory, which I dont think will be hard as I managed to do despite School and stuff, I loved reading so far.</p> <p>What do you think of this? Would you consider it Impressive?</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/SilverNEOTheYouTuber\"> /u/SilverNEOTheYouTuber </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/1qd1xix/what_do_you_think_of_my_reading_progress_so_far/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/1qd1xix/what_do_you_think_of_my_reading_progress_so_far/\">[comments]</a></span>",
