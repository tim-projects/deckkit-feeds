  "description": "<div><p>I was browsing the marxism subreddit to learn their critique of anarchism. What I found is that a lot of them are saying anarchists are idealists, and because of that anarchism would never work. Their arguments were along the lines of \"anarchists have an ideal world in their mind and try to change the world based on it\" or \"anarchists want an idealized version of communism.\" A lot of them also don't understand what anarchism really is, so a lot of their arguments don't make sense to me. My question is, why are we idealists? What does it mean to be an idealist or a materialist? I would also like to ask for help in finding literatures I can read regarding these questions and a literature about marxist critiques on anarchism, of course the writer should be someone who actually understands anarchism. Thanks.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/UglyBaba\"> /u/UglyBaba </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/1qgx200/why_are_anarchists_idealists/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/1qgx200/why_are_anarchists_idealists/\">[comments]</a></span>",
