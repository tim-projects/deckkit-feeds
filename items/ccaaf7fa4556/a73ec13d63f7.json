  "description": "<div><p>With the end of monarchies around the world, the wealthy lost the system where they openly enjoyed full privilege and unconcerned exploitation. For the first time, their inherited power faced real challenges through wealth redistribution, land reforms, labor rights, and better wages.</p> <p>To regain that lost power, they began buying media (including social media), shaping narratives, spreading economic myths, and funding political parties and campaigns. Over time, this allowed them to concentrate wealth on a scale even monarchies never achieved, especially under the neoliberal economic model.</p> <p>Now it feels like we are approaching another global tipping point. Inequality is exploding, wages are stagnant, inflation is increasing disproportionately, entire generations are being locked out of stable futures.</p> <p>Will the future be divided into massive urban centers where the wealthy and professional classes live, surrounded by vast regions of poverty where billions struggle to survive or even die?</p> <p>With AI, automation, and advanced technology, the wealthy may no longer even need to exploit workers. They may not even need the majority of humanity at all.</p> <p>If labor is no longer essential, and political systems are already captured, what leverage do ordinary people have left?</p> <p>What do you think our future looks like? </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Excellent_Place4977\"> /u/Excellent_Place4977 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/1qgkp49/is_the_future_world_heading_toward_a_class_war/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/1qgkp49/is_the_future_world_heading_toward_a_class_war/\">[comments]</a></span>",
