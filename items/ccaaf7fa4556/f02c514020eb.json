  "description": "<div><p>Seems to me that some of the best examples of welfare states “done right” (as right as can be done) on a nations scale are those found in Scandinavia. I am an anarchist, so theoretically speaking I disagree with the Nordic model being the goal, but I do believe they do welfare and social services quite well for a capitalist country in the modern world.</p> <p>So, I’m eager to read the critiques of their model and the realities of these states (and any other critiques of reformism over anarchist revolution). Please recommend!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Apprehensive-Dig825\"> /u/Apprehensive-Dig825 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/1qfoh1i/anarchist_literature_critiquing_strong_welfare/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/1qfoh1i/anarchist_literature_critiquing_strong_welfare/\">[comments]</a></span>",
