  "description": "<div><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I’m in the early stages of building my startup, and so far, we haven’t been using any dedicated communication platform. Most of our team chats happen through WhatsApp and random email threads, which is starting to feel a bit chaotic as we grow.</p> <p>Before we lock into a proper setup, I wanted to get some real advice from other founders and startup teams:</p> <p>What communication tools do you use daily and actually like?</p> <p>Which ones helped your team stay organized without feeling bloated or complicated?</p> <p>Any tools you tried and decided to move away from — and why?</p> <p>I’m looking for something that keeps communication smooth, helps with quick discussions, maybe some file sharing or async updates, but doesn’t overwhelm the team.</p> <p>We’re not looking for expensive, feature-heavy platforms — just something simple, efficient, and reliable that helps us communicate and get work done without the extra noise (or price tag 😅).</p> <p>Would love to hear what’s been working (or not working) for your startups. Real-world experience means way more than marketing pages right now.</p> <p>Appreciate any suggestions </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Delicious_Growth847\"> /u/Delicious_Growth847 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/advancedentrepreneur/comments/1qg224t/looking_for_advice_from_startups/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/advancedentrepreneur/comments/1qg224t/looking_for_advice_from_startups/\">[comments]</a></span>",
