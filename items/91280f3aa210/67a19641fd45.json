  "description": "<div><p>I do not believe in panpsychism, but when I learn about quantum and classic tomfoolery, it is almost like particles speak to eachother with signals like Bosons to exchange information, you could say everything is communication at some level, so the idea of consciousness being fundamental can absolutely fit with science and physics as we know it imo. </p> <p>However, even If consciousness is a spectrum that extends to all layers of reality, the awareness of particles and objects would be so limited that it would be incomprehensible. I don't think the awareness of inanimate objects and particles would be recognizable to us as any form of consciousness even if panpsychism were true. </p> <p>Based on the fact we can't remember anything at all when we were sperm, nor were we capable of it neurologically, the level of self awareness we possesed back then had to be so insignificant. </p> <p>So if panpsychism is true, what does it really mean ? In my personal opinion, it doesn't change my outlook. I don't think rocks or even cells have the concept of an inner self even if they're on the spectrum of consciousness or awareness. </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/Virtual_Reveal_121\"> /u/Virtual_Reveal_121 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1qdgbjh/particles_can_be_described_as_communicating_with/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1qdgbjh/particles_can_be_described_as_communicating_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",
