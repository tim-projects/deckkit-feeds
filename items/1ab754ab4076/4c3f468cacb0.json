So i looked for other content such as in NVG sub. Saw a lot of reports and videos that resemble orb activities at night. Truly unexplainable by aircraft etc.. especially with experts in that sub, you'd know someone who can afford an NVG must have at least the qualities of common sense. Hence best sub to see weird activities at night, peruse it.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/darthsexium\"> /u/darthsexium </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://v.redd.it/fc9cjrlt72ag1\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1pyavuw/goldmine_of_uap_activity_in_nightvision_sub/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
