They were moving fast across the sky, much faster than typical airliners I see. These objects did not appear on my flight tracker app. There are two parts of this clip, both played back in real time; one that shows the original camera perspective, the second part of clip is zoomed in and stabilized </p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/user/ZedAlphaProject\"> /u/ZedAlphaProject </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/i6h951b6iw9g1.gif\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1pxlv0f/3_fast_moving_objects_captured_with_infrared/\">[comments]</a></span> ",
